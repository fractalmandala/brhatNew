			Language reflects a culture's aspirational value to society. It is at the root of creative
			agency of a people.<br /><br />
			But today, this role has been outsourced to the market. This stunts 'cultural confidence'. Languages
			are evaluated not on the worth of their cultural importance but on the utility to get jobs and
			join a specific cultural paradigm.<br /><br />
			Compounding this is the issue of politicization of language in the name of democracy.

		<h4 class="hindiadobe bord-bot p-bot-64">
			All of this leads to <span style="color: #D47915">loss of the vital spirit</span> of a land, of
			its culture and its people.
