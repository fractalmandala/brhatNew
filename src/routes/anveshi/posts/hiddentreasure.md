title: Recreation of Hidden Treasure of Ghazni Ganpati

This year, our Ganpati Bappa is enthroned upon the vast mountains of the Ghazni province in present-day Afghanistan. According to Afghan scholar Abdul Rashid Khaliq, the very word 'Ghazni' derives from the Sanskrit word गज, meaning 'elephant.' Ghazni has a rich Ganpatya tradition, which was further celebrated by its native ruling dynasty, the Lawiks. The Lawiks were devout followers of the Shaiva Sampradaya and ardently promoted the Ganpatya parampara. Local oral accounts reveal that indigenous artists from Ghazni intricately carved numerous Ganapati murtis into the expansive mountain ranges during the reign of the Lawiks. One such colossal murti still exists within a mountain, albeit with its lower portion eroded, while the upper half, including the trunk and teeth, remains intact. Remarkably, due to its earth-toned appearance blending seamlessly with the mountains, it has remained concealed from terrorists, thereby safeguarding this murti from further destruction. 

In our depiction, we have recreated the Ghazni of the 750s, where our beloved Bappa embodies the spirit of that enduring Ganesh murti, concealed somewhere in the remote Ghazni mountains. We can observe an entire settlement nestled at the mountain's base, along with a Mahadwaar at the entrance of Ghazni. According to local lore, this Mahadwaar was constructed by Wujwir Lawik in the 8th century to commemorate a grand welcome extended to the neighboring Kabul Shahi King and Zunbil King during the same era. Notably, the Mahadwaar featured intricately carved Ganpati murtis adorning its battlements.


This is the top view, with showcasing Mahadwar of Ghazni with Ganpati Murti carvings on battlements and flourishing settlements under the Lawiks.

While we were recreating the Ghazni mountain ranges with cardboard and newspapers along with a few kids in our society, a tender conversation unfolded between a curious 8-year-old boy and his understanding elder sister. "Who is decorating Bappa on the real Ghazni mountain?" inquired the boy. His sister gently replied that perhaps no one adorned it. Seeing her brother's disappointment, she was quick to add that a mouse would offer a flower daily for the next 10 days. Filled with hope, the boy says ‘I shall also reserve a flower for Bappa on real Ghazni mountain. His sister nodded, assuring him that the Bappa is watching him even from afar in Ghazni. Hearing this, the boy wondered if Bappa is watching over the people of Ghazni too. The sister replied with an assuring smile, "He has been watching over them for ages." Both children shared a smile and continued their work with cardboard, colors, and fevicol.

In this innocent conversation, they unknowingly internalised the indigenous cultural richness of Afghanistan. 

In reality, it was a celebration of the cultural consciousness of Bharat.

Ganpati Bappa Morya !!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾
