1. You can make text **bold** and *italic* by surrounding it with two and one asterisks on either side, respectively.
2. Headings are created like hashtags — write a `#`-character followed by a space. You can use up to six `######`-characters to create headings from level one through six.
3. Lists are created literally — simply write `*`, `-`, or `+` on a new line. Numbered lists consist of a number followed by a dot.
4. Finally, blockquotes are written exactly as quoted text is displayed in e-mails: Simply demarcate them using `>`.
