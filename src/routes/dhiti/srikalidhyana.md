##### काली | _Kālī_ 

The etymological origin of _Kālī_ is _kāla_. This root word has five meanings: _kṣepa_, _jñāna_, _saṁkhyāna_, _gati_ and _nāda_. These five tell us about the five attributes of _Bhagavatī_. She does _kalana_ in these five ways, hence she is _Bhagavatī_ _Śrī Kālī_ or _Bhagavatī Śrī Kālakarṣiṇī_-

>क्षेपो ज्ञानं च संख्यानं गतिर्नाद इति क्रमात्॥१७३॥
>
>स्वात्मनो भेदनं क्षेपो भेदितस्याविकल्पनम्।
>
>ज्ञानं विकल्पः संख्यानमन्यतो व्यतिभेदनात्॥१७४॥
>
>गतिः स्वरूपारोहित्वं प्रतिबिम्बवदेव यत्।
>
>नादः स्वात्मपरामर्शशेषता तद्विलोपनात्॥१७५॥
>
>इति पञ्चविधामेनां कलनां कुर्वती परा।
>
>देवी काली तथा कालकर्षिणी चेति कथ्यते॥१७६॥

_Kāśmīrīya Śaivādvaya_ talks about twelve forms of _Śrī Bhagavatī._ These are due to the _pramātā_, _pramāṇa_ and _prameya_ stages of _sṛṣṭi_, _sthiti_, _saṁhāra_ and _anākhya_. Of the ten sense organs, _mana_ (mind) and _buddhi_ (intellect) are another manifestation of these twelve forms.

##### In the rest of Bhārata, these forms are known by different names and variations; however, all the forms of _Bhagavatī_ are one.

In _Śrī Mahānirvāṇa Tantra,_ it is mentioned that one who does _kalana_ of all is _Śrī Mahākāla_ and the one who does _kalana_ of _Śrī Mahākāla_ Himself is _Bhagavatī Parā Śrī Ādi Kālī_. It is also said that she eats away even the _kāla_ while being the _Ādi_ form of all. Being the source of _kāla_ and existents, she is called as _Bhagavatī Śrī Kālī_-

>कलनात्सर्वभूतानां महाकालः प्रकीर्तितः ।
>
>महाकालस्य कलनात्त्वमाद्या कालिका परा॥३१॥
>
>कालसंग्रसनात्काली सर्वेषामादिरूपिणी।
>
>कालत्वादादिभूतत्वादाद्याकालीति गीयते॥३२॥

In _Śrī Kālī Tantra_ she is called as administrator of _kāla_ and giver of _tattva jñāna_:

>कालनियन्त्रणात् काली ज्ञानतत्त्वप्रदायिनी।
>
>तस्मात् सर्वप्रयत्नेन यजेदुभयसिद्धये॥१८॥

#### श्मशान | śmaśāna 

Bhagavatī Kālī is associated with the श्मशान (śmaśāna, charnel ground). In general, this is the place where the dead bodies are brought and then cremated. Here श्म (śma) indicates ‘remains’ and शन means ‘to destroy’. It is the place where the jivātma gets completely free from the carnal body, as well as the associated effects of that body like heat and cold, joy and sorrow. Calling this place as the residence of _Bhagavatī_ is significant: as one gives up all the carnal associations, one would see that Mother waiting. 

_Śmaśāna_ is meaning of the _chummakā<sup>1</sup>_ called _ḍāmara_. _Kṣemarāja_ says this śmaśāna is the place of _vīracaryā_ where all the doubts and fear are slayed, and hence being _uḍḍāmara_ this is called as _ḍāmara_:


>किञ्च वीरचर्यास्थानम् –
>
>श्मशानं डामरं ज्ञेयं
>
>समस्तशङ्कातङ्कत्रोटकत्वेन उड्डामरत्वाद् डामरं।

So the _śmaśāna_ is symbolic to the state where the seeker earns the _viveka,_ the power of proper discrimination. Once the _sādhaka_ reaches to this stage, _Bhagavatī_ herself greets that sādhaka with complete love and affection.

#### देवी | _Devī_ 

In general, this _shabda_ (word) means Goddess. As per _Abhinavagupta,_ _Devī_ is _Parā Bhagavatī_ _Saṁvita_ who displays the world as _idantā_ (another object) in the three forms _Paśyantī_, _Madhyamā_ and _Vaikharī_, with her _sva,_ and even then doesn’t lose her real form-

>अहम्’ इति चमत्कृतिःअन्तःकृत-अनन्त-विश्व-इदन्ताचमत्कृतिपूर्णवृत्तिः तत् पश्यन्ती-मध्यमात्मिका स्वात्मानम् एव वस्तुतः परसंविदात्मकं विमृशति। परा एव च संवित – ‘देवी’ इति उच्चते।

The word _Devī_ has evolved from root word _div_. This root word has six meanings: _krīḍā_ (to sport), _vijīgiṣā_ (desire to win), _vyavahāra_ (business), _dyuti_ (to project or display), _stuti_ (to worship) and _gamana_ (transmigration):

* _Parā Śakti_ displays the entire world with Herself as a separate entity. This is the **sport** of _Māṁ Bhagavatī_.
* As the _Parameśvara Bhairava_ is supreme and his _Iccchā Śakti_ also resorts within him to keep him supreme, She is the **desire to win.**
* _Bhagavatī_ drives various kinds of _jñāna_, impressions of memories, doubts, and more; hence, She is into the **business** of operations.
* _Parā Śakti_ **projects** Herself as the essence of subjective and objective existence. This is Her attribute, to **display**.
* All the subjective and objective forms of _Parā Śakti_ are involved in Her worship (in the form of any kind of exchange), so it can be said that She Herself **worships** Her. 
* After creating various existences, She **transmigrates** from one body to another. 

#### मुण्डमाला | _muṇḍa-mālā_ 

Meaning a garland made of skulls, Śrī Kālī’s garland has fifty skulls which represent the fifty letters of _Mātṛkā_. As the _Mātṛkā_ is in _Vaikharī_ form and as the entire world has evolved from _Mātṛkā_, the human skull is the composition of _paratattva_ in _sahasra-kamala,_ it is the sense of the organs. The entire creation from _Śiva_ to _pṛthvi_ is used to represent the _Mātṛkā_. Being in garland form is significant, as these _Mātṛkās_ proudly dedicate themselves to adorn the _Bhagavatī Parābhaṭṭārikā_. This garland is _Śrī Mātṛkā Cakra_ and the _Bhagavatī_ is _Śrī Śrī Cakreśvarī_.

#### शिवा | _Śivā_ 

The _Śakti_ of _Śiva_ is _Śivā._ It is said that this world is precisely the _Śakti,_ and the _Śaktimāna_ is _Maheśvara_:

>शक्तिश्च शक्तिमांश्चेति पदार्थद्वयमुच्यते।
>
>शक्तयोऽस्य जगत् सर्वं शक्तिमांस्तु महेश्वरः॥

All the activities of the world are done by _Śakti;_ and _Śiva_ resorts in inert state, so it is said that _Mantra_ or _sādhanā_ shall be offered to _Śakti_ even if it is for _Parameśvara Śiva_. This is the reason why She called as the _mukha_ or gateway of _Śiva._ However, to enter in this stage, the giving up of one’s individual identity is a must. Again, this is the reason why She is seen as standing in charnel ground:

>शक्त्यावस्थाप्रविष्टस्य निर्विभागेन भावना।
>
>तदासौ शिवरूपी स्यात् शैवी मुखमिहोच्यते॥२०॥

#### खड्ग | khaḍga   

The _khaḍga_ or sword held by Mother is not an ordinary one. It is _jnana khaṅga_, the sword of the intellect, which slays the illusions. Hence, _Bhagavatī_ is _Jñāna Vigrahā_ - the embodiment of the intellect. This _jñāna_ is the inner power of the seeker. This is one of the reasons why the seeker exhibits _khaṅga mudrā_:

>अन्तः शक्तिकृपाणीं व्यनक्षि संसृतिविभेदिनीमसिना।
>
>निजशक्तिमहिमस्वीकृत समस्ताविश्वा हि वीरवराः॥

#### मुण्ड | muṇḍa

The human head comprises of eyes, ears, nose and mouth. It also consists of the _sahasrāra cakra_ and _bhramabila_. Hence, She who holds human head  signifies that She controls both the path of _mokṣa_ and the path of indulgence. She alone is _Parābhaṭṭārikā_, who manifests herself as _Parā_, _Parāparā_ and _Aparā_. 

#### वर | vara

Blessings. What else is it that Mother has for Her children? _Śrī Śrī Parātriṁśikā_ says that the One who is capable of the five acts- creation, operation, destruction, confinement and grace- that One alone is _Parābhaṭṭāraka_ or _Parābhaṭṭārikā_. Even though the five are done eternally, there is _anugraha_ (grace) only behind all the five. This is represented by _vara mudrā_, and _Bhagavatī_ is depicted as blessing Her children; always.

#### अभय | abhaya

Ensuring protection: In _Śrī Durgā Saptaśatī,_ it is mentioned that She is the mother of the entire world. Whosoever is seen as giving refuge to others is empowered by _Bhagavatī_ only:

>रोगानशेषानपहंसि तुष्टा रुष्टा तु कामान् सकलानभीष्टान्।
>
>त्वामाश्रितानां न विपन्नराणां त्वामाश्रिता ह्याश्रयतां प्रयांति॥२९॥

Wherever or whatever the situation, whether surrounded by snakes, enemy or looters, whether trapped in forest fire or in the ocean, you stay there and protect the world, hence, She would always protect you:

>रक्षांसि यत्रोग्रविषाश्च नागा यत्रारयो दस्युबलानि यत्र।
>
>दवानालो यत्रतथाब्धिमध्ये तत्र स्थिता त्वं परिपासि विश्वं॥३२॥

#### शवारूढ़ा | Śavārūḍḥā

The corpse is Her vāhanā or vehicle.

Firstly to be analyzed is- what is a corpse? Whose corpse is it? When the first question would be answered, the second would be answered on its own.

Corpse: In general, the corpse is a dead body, that body without any capability or _Śakti_. In _Śrī Saundarya Laharī_ this fact is mentioned in the very first śloka as:

>शिवः शक्त्या युक्तो यदि भवति शक्तः प्रभवितुं 
>
>न चेदेवं देवो न खलु कुशलः स्पंदितुमपि | 
>
>अतस्त्वाम् आराध्यां हरि-हर-विरिन्चादिभि रपि 
>
>प्रणंतुं स्तोतुं वा कथ-मुक्त पुण्यः प्रभवति ||१||

_Śiva_ without _Śakti_ only is _Śava_. While looking at the thirty-six _tattvas,_ it can be clearly observed that at first (_Śiva_ level), _Śiva_ and _Śakti_ are one; though at the level of _Sadāśiva,_ He appears as separate from _Śakti_. This _Śadāśiva_ form alone is called as _śava_ here. He is also called as _Mahāpreta_ because:

As He comprises of all the _tattvas_ up to _Īśvara_ within, he is called as _Mahāpreta_:

>रुद्रोर्ध्वे चेश्वरं देवं तदूर्ध्वे च सदाशिवं।
>
>न्यसेत्स च महाप्रेत इति शास्त्रेषु भण्यते॥३०९॥
>
>समस्ततत्त्वव्याप्तृत्वान्महाप्रेतः प्रबोधतः।
>
>प्रकर्षगमनाच्चैष लीनो यन्नाधरं व्रजेत॥३१०॥

His _mahatva_ (might) and pervasion as _tattvas_ alone made Him _Mahāpreta_.

Moreover, there is significance behind this name _Mahāpreta._ _Preta_ is a transmigrating soul and as _Sadāśiva tattva_ represents the transmigration from impure _adhvā_ to pure _adhvā,_ plus this _tattva_ is the cause behind supreme transition, he called as _Mahāpreta_. 

Hence, the _śava_ is _Mahāpreta Sadāśiva_, and when the _Bhagavatī_ puts Her feet on his chest, he reaches to the level of _Śiva_.

In _Śrividyā sādhanā_ the _Bhagavatī_ is contemplated upon as sitting on _Sadāśiva_, while here as Kālī She is seen as standing on _Sadāśiva._ Both are eternally the same. In _Kāśmīrīya Śaivādvaya_ it is said that _Bhagavatī Parābhaṭṭārikā-_ the one who manifests as _Parā_, _Parāparā_ and _Aparā-_ sits on the trident blown out of the naval of _Sadāśiva_:

 
>तस्य नाभ्युत्थितं शक्तिशूलश्रृड़्गत्रयं स्मरेत्।
>
>कखत्रयेण निर्यातं द्वादशन्तावसानकम्॥६९॥

This is the reason why seekers are supposed to perform _sādhanā_ on _pañcamuṇḍī āsana<sup>2</sup>_.

#### हसन्मुखी | Hasanmukhī

She with the laughing face: The mother is always happy to protect and help her child. She would always be happy when She would see that Her child is on the right path. As the seeker who is none other than Her child traversing on this serene right path, She is happy.

The above reflections are a small effort to look at the real form of Mother. One should not stop here, as this is just a glimpse. Her real form can not be captured in words. It is the duty of her dutiful child to explore more and more, for the sake of Her grace.

#### FootNote:

1. _chummakā_ is a type of encoded word usage found in Kāśmīrīya Śaiva Tantra śastra.
2. The Śrī Śrī Navamuṇḍī Mahāsana article written by M.M. Gopinath Kaviraj provides a better understanding of this aspect.
