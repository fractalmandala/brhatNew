#### The Indian Ontological View of Reality 

The Indic worldview emerges from a civilization spanning thousands of years. It is a tradition that is living, vibrant and unbroken across the ravages of time. Because Indic worldview is diametrically opposed to the Western worldview imposed upon us today, it has the potential to completely change how we view the world, the nature of existence, and our fundamental ideas of what constitute purposeful living - if and when we study the Indic thought carefully and experience it through practice.

As per Nisbett et al., (2001), Asian thought is holistic because it focuses on the context in which an object is situated, and emphasizes on the dynamics between the object and the context. Asian thought makes place for both experiential knowledge and formal logic and is holistic in its purview. It analyzes and integrates smaller components into a comprehensive, sustainable whole.

Consciousness-as-such is central to the Indic worldview. It is the substratum, the underlying interweave of both the manifest and the unmanifest. It is from Consciousness that creation manifests itself and dissolves back into. It goes by various names in the principal scriptures (_śāstras_) of _Sanātana Dharma_ - namely _Brahma_ or _Sat-Cit-Ānanda_. 

As opposed to the Western physicalist view, which continues to look at consciousness as a derivative of neural processes, in Indic thought it is the one, continuous Reality that is present in all states of being, from which all life emerges and plays out. According to verses in the _Chāndogya Upaniṣad_, the human being is an integral part of the entire larger cosmos, which itself is an expression of Consciousness. While recent empirical studies are beginning to point out that plant and animal lives seem to be imbued with consciousness, the _Upaniṣads_ have spoken of this long ago. 

This Consciousness is of the nature of _Sat_, meaning it is unchangeable across the three periods of time. It is _Cit_, meaning it is dynamic consciousness and the potent, unmanifest seed of creation itself. It is _Ānanda_, which is unbroken infinitude or bliss, beyond the realms of momentary mental joy that we know of. 

The attainment of this state is not to be considered as philosophy alone but has been the lived reality of many _Ṛṣis_ in deep meditative states. The attainment of Consciousness-as-such is in fact the highest goal (_Mokṣa_) of human life in the Indic worldview. 

This unmanifest principle is represented in the cosmos as _Ṛta_, the cosmic order that governs universal processes. It is the design through which Sat, or the Truth manifests as Being. In the human plane, _Dharma_ is the analogue for _Ṛta_. If _Ṛta_ is the cosmic design, _Dharma _is a societal design cognized through the meditative experiences of the _Ṛṣis_ who were able to access _Ṛta_. 

While _Dharma_ is a highly nuanced term, it includes all the socio-cultural mechanisms and restraints that serve to refine human subjectivity to allow this species to access Sat and thereby a living that is deeply fulfilling.

#### Relationship with Self 

In Advaita Vedānta which is one of the six schools of Indian philosophy, Ādi Śaṅkarācarya, places the following two fundamental principles of cognition - 

1. There is a Reality which is Consciousness-as-such, which is one’s true nature but is obscured by the limitations of embodied cognition. 
2. _Avidyā_ is a fundamental cognitive error that veils my understanding of Reality _(āvaraṇa)_ and projects an illusion as reality _(vikṣepa)_ (Rao & Paranjpe, 2016).

In this section we take the _Vedāntic/Sāṃkhyan_ understanding of the Self. In contemporary psychology, emphasis is given to the ego identity as the continuous cohering aspect of human personality. This ego identity is bound by repressed desires and moral injunctions which often leads to a fragmented experience of the world around. 

In the _Vedāntic_/Indic worldview, there are three aspects to the self. There is the empirical self which corresponds to the ego identity, bound by the experiences of the body-mind complex. This _jīva_ is an integral part of the cosmos and traverses across different lifetimes, time and space coordinates, to finally dissolve in Consciousness-as-such, in a state which is beyond thought and cognition. It acts, enjoys and cognizes. It has impeccable will and the creative power of intent to achieve whatever it seeks to _(saṅkalpa śakti)_ (Rao & Paranjpe, 2016, pg 168-171).

The _jīva_ has a specific goal which channelizes the power of its will in one direction - of stilling all thought and refining its subjectivity to realize Consciousness-as-such _(Brahmaṇ)_. All practices that we know of in systems such as _Yoga_ and _Āyurveda_ are aimed at supporting this goal alone. 

This process is also known as _antaḥ-karana śuddhi_ or _citta-śuddhi,_ achieved through a deeply concentrated form of contemplation and meditation. Every mechanism in Indian culture or _Sanātana Dharma_, seeks to nurture and facilitate _citta-śuddhi_. It is aimed at giving us a taste of what refinement of our innate tendencies (_saṃskāras_) and conscious reallocation of cognitive resources inwards, feels like. It also shapes how we act, or how we utilize our free will as human beings. 

Our actions or karmas tend to leave impressions which take root in the unconscious as seeds that will sprout in the future. This ties into the idea that we must keep coming back across lifetimes to fulfill these desires. As Deshpande (1979) observes, time in Indic thought is cyclical, running through creation, sustenance and dissolution. This principle warrants restraint and care rather than sanctioning indulgence. The practice of refining one's subjectivity to release oneself from the impressions of actions is not only emphasized, but is embedded into the rituals and customs of the civilization. 

Earlier we had spoken of how life experiences may hand us out maladaptive patterns of thinking and feeling. _Yogic_ processes such as _Pratyāhāra_ aim at re-patterning and assessing in long periods of silent observation, the psychodrama that plays out within us. They clear out cognitive errors and alter our entire perception of reality and living. 

The second critical aspect of the Self is what we know as the _Ātman_. It can be understood as a non-physical, witnessing, objective entity which is beyond the knower and the enjoyed and is rather the enabler of these very processes. It is the witnessing Self or the _Sākṣī_ which is in essence, nothing but _Brahmaṇ_ or Consciousness-as-such. It is in this unsullied state that _Sat_ and _ṛta_, I.e. Absolute Truth can be accessed. _Brahmaṇ_, is then the third and the final aspect of the Self, the home of the _jīva_ (Rao & Paranjpe, 2016, pg 129-133).

What is unique about this worldview is that in the refinement of individual subjectivity and awareness, the collective is nurtured by the very presence of such an evolved person, which takes us into the next exploration. 

#### Relationship with Others

As per Triandis (1990), collectivist cultures emphasize on dependence, conformity, group goals, duties, and long-term thinking. Because the Indic worldview stems from the backdrop of the presence of Consciousness-as-such in every life form, it advocates the virtues of oneness, empathy and seva or selfless service. 

Our society therefore has evolved as one based on duties rather than on individual rights. It was built on the principle that if we fulfill our duties with due respect, our rights are automatically safeguarded. This is the premise that _dharma_ advocates and strives to uphold. 

The Indian civilization has devised an enduring framework of organizing life which permeated into all its layered social institutions. The _puruṣārthas_ or the four goals of life are meant to guide and define all our individual and social pursuits. The foremost is _dharma_, which sustains, upholds and anchors the other _puruṣārthas_. 

It is dynamic and ever-evolving to adapt to the changes in society. But it has the attainment of prosperity (_abhyudaya_) and the attainment of the highest good (_niḥśreyasa_) at its center (Rao & Paranjpe, 2016, pg 50-51).

A _dhārmika_ worldview does not operate at the cost of other beings. It functions for alignment, well-being, order and sustainability. _Dharma_ is both social "ethics" which define one's duties towards the world around and it is one's own innate nature or purpose that one is asked to fulfill during this lifetime. 

_Artha_ is human activity directed towards acquisition of goods for satisfaction and fulfillment of the individual and collective, within the boundaries of _dharma_. _Kāma_, is our pursuit of pleasures and desires, once again within the framework of _dharma_. Think of the value frameworks and the lifestyle guidelines given at each stage such as the and we will see how restraint and free will coexist in this society. 

_Mokṣa_ (self-evolution) remains a silent calling and pursuit in most of our lives, even as we pursue _artha-kāma_. The idea of a higher goal, a larger vision and greater freedom not to indulge but to experience higher states of consciousness, is embedded into the daily life and fabric of people in the Indic civilization. 

Earlier we had alluded to how language is the basis for cognition. _Saṃskṛta_, the ancient language of India, derived from sublime states of consciousness by the _ṛṣis,_ is constructed to facilitate cognitive excellence. For example, the very structure of the language shows a deep understanding of linguistic patterns and cognitive processes. The advent of modern-day education has led to an internal fragmentation of the individual.  The key to establishing harmony also lies in unlocking the doors to what _Saṃskṛta_ holds and bringing it back into education and practice.   

Modern theories such as cultural evolution of intelligence by Prof Michael Muthukrishna also allude to how cultural processes and transmissions across generations contribute to enhancement of one's cognitive resources and facilitates decision-making, innovation and expression of intelligence within the population. 

#### Relationship with Nature

The attitudes towards nature in India and the West are deeply rooted in the cultural fabric of these civilizations. In the West, we had earlier looked at Rene Descartes and his mind-body dualism. We also have Francis Bacon who posited man as the Lord of nature. 

In India or _Bhārata_ on the other hand, we have the _upaniṣads_ which tell us that the human being is an integral part of the world of animate and inanimate beings; and that Consciousness as an immanent, underlying principle throbs in all life forms, be they simple or complex. We are but a manifestation of the same Conscious principle, an extension of the creative powers of nature (Rao & Paranjpe, 2016, pg 44-46).

This puts us in a space of co-existing with and respecting the processes of nature as sacred. _prakṛti_, the _saṃskṛta_ term for nature, literally means that which is the source of creation. She is worshiped as a deity. Each aspect of _prakṛti_, in _Bhārata_, is associated with a powerful deity from the time of the _Vedas_. Humans have engaged in a give-and-take relationship with nature, which in turn upholds cosmic order and processes. We are not owners but caretakers of the natural order. It is imbued as a sacred duty in our civilization ethos. 

Culture serves to preserve nature. For example, several folk festivals such as _saṅkrānti_ or _pongal_ are celebrated in honor of the deities who ensure that the cosmic cycles are upheld to nourish the earthly realm. Villages in India have long followed a lifestyle that is self-sustaining and moves in a symbiotic relationship with nature (Rao & Paranjpe, 2016, pg 44-46).

Today as we look at discourses surrounding sustainability, there is perhaps nowhere else to turn but an understanding of nature that is _dhārmika_, that is anchored in sacred ecology in a sense of awe, respect and deep gratitude.

#### To Conclude

We set out to understand the state of the individual and global mind today, and we need to look towards a civilization that has been around since the longest time, for viable solutions. We also put out why we need an emic lens to analyze what we have, over the etic perspectives we have been used to. How do we bring this about other than through a lived and experienced cognitive shift to begin with?

It was therefore essential to understand the processes of perception and cognition and how they are intrinsically linked to the macro-ecosystem of the native culture. We analyzed the present worldview that has been imported into our educational systems. We then entered the most critical part of the piece, where we looked at the civilizational perspective of reality and Self. 

By now we would have gained an overview of why _Sānatana Dharma_ has solutions implicit and explicit in its ontological principles and its cultural practices to complex problems of the world; and why we need to reclaim our way of viewing the world, the Self, and nature roo-and-shoot, without any form of divorce from its metaphysical origins and goals. 

Perhaps it is time we had a relook at our definitions of happiness, and relationships with nature and fellow beings, from a lens that centers on purpose and harmony.
