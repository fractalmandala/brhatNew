#### Introduction to Our Theatre

A famous Odia poet Kabibara Radhanath Ray describes the world as a _raṅgabhūmi_ or a theatre, and man’s life as a limited-period performance. Imagine being in a theatre. When the actors are fully engrossed in their roles, they forget their original identities. They act as per the script, props, and the drama’s artifacts. For example, a horse-shaped wooden structure becomes a real horse that they ride for a war. 

The horse is untrue for us but not for the audience, the actors, and the entire ecosystem which is in complete immersion. The wooden horse is a symbol for the set to explain the abstraction of the qualities of a real horse away from its actual plane of existence. It then holds the truth of the horse. 

Now think of this world as a stage and all the men and women as mere players. They need props and scripts to navigate. Every artifact in this world is a symbol, with multiple layers of meaning embedded. These symbols are real. The proponents of the Nyāya Vaiśeṣika school of Indian philosophy call out the entities of this theatre, the world, as _padārthaḥ_ (_padasya arthaḥ_) or referents of a term (1). We understand the world, the theatre, through names and forms, _nāma-rūpa_. Language describes these names and forms. The terms of language are real for us for they hold the thought-meaning of these forms and names. Everything is real here.

In contrast, Śaṅkarācārya’s Advaita Vedānta speaks of the theatre-like world as apparent or relative reality - _vyavahārika sattā_. Everything is apparent - transactional, temporal. “_Brahma satyaṃ jaganmithyā_”. Truth (alone) is, the world is not. _Mithyā_ is not falsehood, but rather phenomenal - to be and not to be, that which exists and exists not. Śrī Aurobindo disagrees with the description of _mithyā_ for _jagat_, the world. The world is as real as the _Brahman_. Kashmir Shaivism also accepts the world as real as _Śiva_ since the world emerges from _Śiva_.

My aim here is not to do a comparative study or a synthesis, but to showcase the complexity. The complexity of the philosophies and making sense of reality - Absolute or apparent. How does one comprehend of which he is a part? How does one comprehend that which is not comprehensible? How does one comprehend the existence and the negation of existence simultaneously? How does one comprehend the multiple layers, the interplay of these layers?


#### The Chariot as a Metaphor

Well, what do you do if the world is a theatre? You use the props - the symbols, the allegories herein, for the actor and audience to make sense of their world. Just like the wooden horse. Whether it’s a wooden horse or a chariot in our world, it’s all symbols. Let us look at a symbolism used in _Kaṭhopaniṣad_ from _Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda_ (2).


> ###### आत्मानँ रथितं विद्धि शरीरँ रथमेव तु ।
>
> ###### बुद्धिं तु सारथिं विद्धि मनः प्रग्रहमेव च ॥ 1:3:3
>
> ###### इन्द्रियाणि हयानाहुर्विषयाँ स्तेषु गोचरान् ।
>
> ###### आत्मेन्द्रियमनोयुक्तं भोक्तेत्याहुर्मनीषिणः ॥ 1:3:4
>
> ###### ātmānaɱ rathitaṁ viddhi śarīraɱ rathameva tu |
>
> ###### buddhiṁ tu sārathiṁ viddhi manaḥ pragrahameva ca || 1:3:3
>
> ###### indriyāṇi hayānāhurviṣayāɱ steṣu gocarān |
>
> ###### ātmendriyamanoyuktaṁ bhoktetyāhurmanīṣiṇaḥ || 1:3:4

The _ātman_ or the Self is the master or rider of a chariot- _ratha_, while the body is the chariot.  The discriminating intellect or _viveka buddhi_ is the charioteer, while the mind is the reins. The senses or _indriyas_ are the horses. The objects of this world that the senses comprehend are the roads on which the chariot treads. The intelligent say that the _ātman_ attached to the body, mind and senses is a _bhoktā_ or enjoyer of things and other beings. We may understand that it runs after the pleasurable.

The successive verses explain that just like a good charioteer should hold the reins and navigate the horses steadily for the chariot to tread properly on the roads, the intellect must hold steady the fluctuating nature of the mind and command the horse-like senses. This helps the chariot of the body navigate the sensory world of objects.

If the charioteer-like intellect is incompetent, then there is complete mayhem in the chariot; as the reins of the mind go slack or are not in control, and the horse-like senses go wayward in the indulgence of what might be pleasurable (_preyas_) instead of what is preferable (_śreyas_), i.e., the firmness and steadiness to navigate the chariot are lost. This symbolism in the Upaniṣad helps explain the body-mind complex and unravel the several layers of our being.

Now let’s attempt to connect this knowledge from the Upaniṣads with Arjuna’s chariot at Kurukṣetra. The _ātman/jīva_ that is Arjuna- the rider, the warrior - was a _bhoktā_, when the armies of the two sides came face-to-face. His mind was overwhelmed with emotions of many kinds- escapism, fear, delusion. It needed the discriminating intellect _(viveka buddhi)_ of Śrī Kṛṣṇa for an effective resolution. 

This consecration of Śrī Kṛṣṇa within Arjuna’s chariot caused a veritable shift of a battle-ridden Kurukṣetra into a sacred and liberating Dharmakṣetra for Arjuna. Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the charioteer could rein in the mind and horse-like senses of Arjuna’s chariot-like body in the sensory world of Kurukṣetra.

This evolution of Arjuna, the rider, from a _bhoktā_ (enjoyer) to a _draṣṭā_ (observer) should be our preferred story, of every actor of the _theatre_ or every warrior of Kurukṣetra.

Again, let us connect this Upaniṣad with a grand ritual of our times- The _Ratha Jātrā (Chariot festival)_ of Puri Jagannātha temple. Mahāprabhu Jagannātha or Śrī Puruṣottama descends from the _Vaikuṇṭha_, i.e. the _Śrī Mandira_ every year, and sits in the chariot with horses and reins, to travel down to the phenomenal world or the world of _padārtha-s._ 

The road in front of Puri _Śrī Mandira_ on which the chariots are pulled is literally called _'Baḍa Dānḍa_' or the grand road. The temple is veritably _Vaikuṇṭha_ from which Mahāprabhu Jagannātha descends, to sit on a body-like chariot with sensory horses, and walk on the mortal phenomenal sensory world of ours - the grand road. He takes a journey, an exemplary one indeed, to regularly reinstate The Eternal Truth. 

This Truth is the independent existence of the Rider of the chariot, and that the mind-body complex exists to serve the realization of this supreme knowledge.


#### The Story of Naciketā*

Thus far we have seen how symbols and allegories help in our comprehension and embodying of knowledge. The Upaniṣads have more of such episodes. Let us look at the central story of the _Kaṭhopaniṣad_ to know more.

The story goes like this: Once a king named _Vājaśravasa_, desirous of _svarga_, was conducting a _viśvajīt yajña_ in which he was supposed to give away his belongings as _dāna_ to the brāhmaṇas. His son named _Naciketā_, possessing great _śraddhā_, observed his father giving away old and destitute cows instead of young, sturdy ones. 

He thought to himself, if one presents such poor and destitute cows then, he would reach a world of destitution post leaving the mortal plane. As Naciketā too belonged to his father, he went and asked his father, "To whom shall you offer your son?" When asked this question thrice, an irritated Vājaśravasa said, "Go, I offer you to Death."

Naciketā, as a virtuous son, then travels to the palace of _Yama_- the Lord of Death, and waits for three days as Yama was away. Yama on returning is surprised at the young boy's courage and grants him three boons in lieu for keeping a young brāhmaṇa waiting for three days. Naciketā first asks that his father achieve tranquility and serenity of mind and recognize him after his return from the realm of Death.  

In the second boon he asks for the fire that leads one to _svarga_. Yama grants him both the boons and also grants a fourth boon saying that henceforth the fire would be named as _Naciketā-agni_. Finally, Naciketā asks for the last boon. Yama tests Naciketā’s eligibility before expounding on the Knowledge sought in the last boon. This discussion on the final boon forms the crux of this Upaniṣad, quantitatively and qualitatively.


#### The Fire as Symbol

Let us take a deeper look at the symbolism of fire or _agni_ which seems to come up repeatedly in the text (3):

- Naciketā is described as fire - _Vaiśvānaraḥ,_ by the attendants of Yama, when Yama returns after three days (1:1:7).
- Yama is addressed as the son of the luminous Sun - _Vivasvān_ (1:1:7).
- In his second boon, Naciketā seeks the fire that leads to _svarga_ (1:1:13).
- In reply, _Yama_ refers to _agni_ as the foundation of all existence, as that which leads to the infinite and remains hidden in the secret cave of our being (1:1:14).
- _Yama_ describes _agni_ as the beginning of existence (1:1:15).
- Next, a pleased Yama proclaims that the _agni_ which shall lead one to _svarga_ will be named after Naciketā henceforth. He also gifts him a precious multiform necklace (1:1:16).
- _Yama_ proclaims that whosoever lights the fire, now named after Naciketā, thrice and performs three specific rites, comes to union with the Three and gets to know the Being, born from Brahma (1:1:17). He surpasses all sorrows and rejoices in _svarga_ (1:1:18).

Let's make an attempt to analyze these statements. The fire sought as the second boon here is “the celestial force concealed subconsciously in man's mortality; by the kindling of which, and its right ordering, man transcends his earthly nature; not the physical flame of the external sacrifice to which these profound phrases are inapplicable”(4). Thus, this _agni_ is nothing but the universal consciousness shining within us. It is that knowledge which liberates us from an individualized notion of consciousness. It is an eternal and internal flame we are talking about, of which the physical flame is only a representation.

_Agni_ is also a “_devatā_, one of the most brilliant and powerful of the masters of the intelligent mind”(5). The intelligent mind is the highest state of the _manomaya kośa_- the third sheath of our human self (6). Also this _manomaya kośa_ has principles/domains corresponding to all _kośas_(sheaths) of human self. 

For example, the domain of the intelligent mind corresponding to the second sheath, i.e. vital body (_prāṇamaya kośa_) is the agent of desire. This is fractal design in operation in the _kośas_ of being. Every sheath is intertwined with other sheaths and the system operates on the idea of integrality. 

Śrīi Aurobindo says about _manomaya kośa_ or the intelligent mind: 

> ###### “In man, as he is at present developed, the intelligent mind is the most important psychological faculty and it is with a view to the development of the intelligent mind to its highest purity and capacity that the hymns of the Veda are written.”(7)

From this we derive that the fire when describing a waiting Naciketā is “_sahaituka tapas_ in the mind”(8). _Sahaituka tapas_ is the motivated conscious force or the pure “Will in action — not desire, but Will embracing desire and exceeding it. It is not even choice, wish or intention. Will, in the Vedic idea, is essentially knowledge taking the form of force. Agni, therefore, is purely mental force, necessary to all concentration ”(9). Thus, when Naciketā is glowing like a fire, it means the yogic force and aspiration that seeks the _jñāna_- _agni_ or flame of self-knowledge. 

##### **Agni seeks Agni. Fire breathes Fire.**

For this agni, i.e. 'a concentrated will in action’, to be channelized, the prerequisite is the _śraddhā_, or a complete dedication and surrender to the cause of knowledge. Complementary to complete surrender is the rejection of falsehood or impurities of one’s self. Therefore, we may understand that Naciketā acted from a space of śraddhā when he witnessed his father giving away old and destitute cows. At this stage, we observe surrender to the cause of knowledge.

His questioning of this act shows a rejection of the impurities, inherent or acquired, within us. Further, his burning like fire in _Yamaloka_ is a channelizing of his 'will in action' towards a higher, nobler aspiration. 

##### The triple acts of aspiration, rejection and surrender for evolution and ascent of the force are thus explained here.

#### The Sun as Symbol

_Sūryadeva_, also known as _Vivasvān_, is the _devatā_ of _satyam_ or _vijñānamaya kośa_, the ideal mind, which is the fourth sheath of the manifestation of being (10). Similarly _Viṣṇu_ is the _devatā_ of the _ānandamaya koṣa_, which is the purely blissful fifth sheath of the manifestation of being. But both _Sūrya_ and _Viṣṇu_ can only manifest through _Agni_. Or in other words for the development of intelligent mind (_manomaya kośa_- which is the domain of _Agni_) to its highest purity, the _Sūrya_(_prakāśa_) and the _Viṣṇu_ (_vaidyutam_) must descend from their corresponding higher planes of _vijñāna_ and _ānanda_, respectively.

This is a fractal design in operation - where _Agni_ as the presiding deity attains primacy before _Sūrya_ and _Viṣṇu_. To better understand the fractal design - the worship of one deity or development of one faculty doesn’t negate the others. In fact reinforcement occurs from other deities for integral manifestation. The principle is same for all faculties of being.

“The _prakāśa and vaidyutam_ can only become active when they enter into Agni and work under the conditions of his being'' as “Agni himself is the supplier of Surya”(11). 

Alternatively, “this means that Agni, commanding as he does heat and cold, is the fundamental active energy behind all phenomena of light and heat; the Sun is merely a reservoir of light and heat”(12). Also it is to be noted that “the peculiar luminous blaze of the sun being only one form of tejas and what we call sunlight is composed of the static energy of prakasha or essential light”(13). The former Sun is a cosmic principle (a _devatā_) while the latter sun is the physical sun of our solar system. Yet the latter is an integral part of the former. 

Now we comprehend what it means when _Yama_(son of _Sūrya_) meets Naciketā, the glowing fire. The principle in action is the descent of _Sūrya_ towards _Agni_. It is the descent of _vijñāna_ for the evolution and full development of the intelligent mind (_manomaya kośa_). Naciketā represents the ascending force - the focused, individual ‘will in action’. Yama as son of _Vivasvān_(_Sūrya_) represents the descending force of the universal Truth.

#### The Triple Beings

Let us go back to verses (1:1:14) and (1:1:15) of the _Kaṭhopaniṣad_. We saw how fire is described by _Yama_ as the foundation of existence and path to the infinite. It is symbolic of the embodied knowledge that is essential for evolution of finite consciousness. This Knowledge is accessed when the pure 'will in action' is channelised. This can be accessed from the hidden cave of our being, meaning this agni is already present within us.

This embodying of knowledge is the naming of the fire as Naciketā, the meeting of the ascending and the descending forces, the embedding of fractal principle and the development of the intelligent mind. The act of lighting the Naciketā fire thrice and performing the three prescribed rites in verse (1:1:17) symbolises “the divine force utilised to raise to divinity the triple being of man”(14). The triple beings are the physical body (_annamaya kośa_), the vital body (_prāṇamaya kośa_) and the mental body (_manomaya kośa_).

- The physical body or the “physical consciousness is that part which directly responds to physical things and physical Nature, sees the outer only as real, is occupied with it” (15).
- The vital body is the seat of desires, emotions, passions, sensations, feelings, longings, reactions etc (16).
- The mental body refers to human cognition and intelligence (17).

The three states of a man - physical, vital and mental are individualised or localised in nature. They pose limits to the realisation of the universal nature of microcosm i.e., the man in this case. Hence, the need for raising to divinity, the triple ignorant beings of man. Let's now have a look at the universal personalities of **_The Being - Puruṣa._**


#### The Three Syllabi - _A U M_

This act of evolution or raising to divinity results in union with the three states of the _Puruṣa_ which is represented by the three symbols of _A U M_(18). There are four parts, personalities or quarters of the Cosmic Being. Correspondingly, so of the individual being. Just as in microcosm so as in macrocosm. Let’s look at each one by one.

**“The first quarter of the Self is Vaiśvānara whose sphere of activity is the waking state”**(19). **This is represented by the sound _A_.** Here one’s consciousness is directed towards external objects. This is the _sthūla śarīra_ or gross body. The gross body of the cosmic being, macrocosm, is _viśva_ and the individual being, microcosm, is _vaiśvānara_. The goal of evolution for this state can be understood as an identification or attainment of oneness with the Cosmic Body - _Viśva_. 

**“The second quarter is Taijasa whose sphere of activity is the dream state”**(20). **This is represented by the sound _U_.** Here consciousness is directed towards internal objects (objects nonetheless). This is the _sūkṣma śarīra_ or the subtle body. The actions from the waking state create impressions. These impressions reflect in the dream state. It is these creative reflections that build internal objects. The impressions, known as _saṃskāras_, are subtle. These impressions in mind are the cause for the cycle of births and deaths.

The Cosmic Mind, macrocosm, is known as _Hiraṇyagarbha prajāpati_ while the individual mind, microcosm, is _taijasa_. Taijasa translates to ‘light of self’ and self here is the _antaḥkaraṇa_- namely the _manaḥ_(mind), _buddhi_(discretionary intellect), _ahaṃkāra_(the I-sense) and _citta_(reflections of sub and unconscious). The light here refers to the self-reflective actions of the _saṃskāras_ or impressions. For example, the inner consciousness creates subtle internal images by reflecting on the impressions stored in _citta_(sub and unconscious). It is just like a mirror image. Just like a dream! The goal for evolution here can be understood as an identification with the Cosmic Mind - _Hiraṇyagarbha prajāpati_.

**“The third quarter is Prājña whose sphere is deep sleep”**(21). **This is represented by the sound M.** Here there is no enjoyment of external or internal objects. There are no impressions or reflections. This is the _kāraṇa śarīra_ or the causal body. Consciousness is undifferentiated here. The duality of object and subject vanishes. The object, subject and the relationship between them becomes one. In the world of _padarthas_, the _pada_(term), the _artha_ (the meaning embedded) and the referent relationship also become one.

There is no multiplicity. There is no ‘I’ here. So how could there be external objects or internal impressions! Because there is no manifestation or creation in this state. This is a state of unmanifest (_avyakta_). The Cosmic Causal Body, macrocosm, is known as _prāṇa_, the first descendant of the Absolute, while the individual causal body is _prājña_. The evolution here is to identify with or attain union with undifferentiated Consciousness, i.e. Cosmic _Prāṇa._

The entire play is embedded within a fractal design. One can enter a dream-like state while in the waking state. Don't we reflect on our thoughts in the waking state? One can also enter the deep sleep state from the waking state. This, however, is difficult for most to relate.

A person in deep meditation or a dancer completely engrossed in the art may momentarily relate to this. Imagine you are concentrating on a light source from a lamp. There are three things - you, the light and the relationship between both, i.e. your vision. This is the waking state. In the deep sleep state, the three become one. You, the light source and the vision are one - undifferentiated.

#### Back to Naciketā

Anyways, if we remember the attendants of Yama referred to Naciketā as _vaiśvānara_ when he was waiting at the gates of the palace. Why? Because Naciketā’s consciousness at that state was still directed towards external objects. He was identified with his gross body. And the grant of the second boon brought about a transformation in him. 

The identification with the Cosmic Body - _Viśva_, then with Cosmic Mind - _Hiraṇyagarbha prajāpati_, and finally with Cosmic _Prāṇa_. This is a journey that Naciketā took. The journey of _AUM_. It was possible due to the burning _agni_- the concentrated will in action. And this was preceded by _śraddhā_- complete surrender and rejection of impurities of the mind.

Anyone who rekindles the triple forces of aspiration, rejection and surrender will be able to ignite an ascent of the force from below which in turn will lead to a descent of the force from above. The former ascending force is a human effort while the latter descending is a divine mystical force.

If you possess _śraddhā_ and _tapa-agni_ then Śrī Kṛṣṇa will consecrate in your chariot and Mahāprabhu Jagannātha will descend from Puri _Śrī Mandira_ to conduct your _ratha jātrā,_ the journey in the sensory world. The Divine Mother, Mā Durgā, will descend down sitting on a lion to kill the demon king _Mahiṣāsura_. Ahh, another story from Devī Mahātmya! Another set of allegories! Maybe we decode some other time. For now, this is the knowledge spoken of by Yama to Naciketā. 

The knowledge about the several layers, states, personalities and fragmentation of our being and how to become integral. It is after Naciketā’s transformation of consciousness that Yama gives him a multiform necklace, representative of the workings of Prakriti (22) or the laws of karma (23). Naciketā now understands the fractal coils of nature, the law behind births and deaths, and the ignorance is gone. He has known all the _Devatās_- the cosmic forces or the commanders of psychic realms (24). He knows the three syllabi of _AUM_.

Yet the _Kaṭha Upaniṣad_ has hardly begun. _Yama_ is reluctant to grant him the third boon. Naciketā is adamant but he has to pass the tests of Yama. He has to prove his eligibility for such sacred knowledge. It is not free for all. Why is it so? Who is the rider of the chariot we spoke about? Who is that warrior in the _Kurukṣetra_? Can we still remain in the theatre and understand the third boon? The pertinent question remains - What is That?
