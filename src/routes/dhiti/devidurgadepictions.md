##### ॐ दुर्गायै नमः

##### oṃ durgāyai namaḥ.


>शरणागतदीनार्तपरित्राणपरायणे।  
>सर्वस्यार्तिहरे देवि नारायणि नमोऽस्तु ते॥  

>O Devī Nārāyaṇī, the one who is dedicated to protecting and rescuing the helpless and distressed, we bow to you.  

This śloka is a part of the Devī Sūktam, which is a hymn from the Ṛgveda. The Devī Sūktam is a text dedicated to the Goddess and praises Her various attributes.

In Hindū scriptures, Devī Durgā is the most splendid manifestation of Devī who represents heavenly strength, courage, and the ultimate victory of good over evil. Durgā, the goddess of the universe, exhibits a diverse array of forms and facets. She is revered in a total of 64 manifestations, including but not limited to Āryadurgā, Vedagarbhā, Ambikā, Bhadrakālī, Bhadrā, Kṣemākṣemakarī, and Naikabāhu. In southern India, the goddess is revered to a greater extent in her formidable and awe-inspiring manifestations. In her more subdued manifestations, Devī Durgā takes on the embodiments of Kanyā, Kāmākṣī, and Mūkāmbā. In the state of Kerala, the goddess Devī is referred to as Bhagavatī. Similarly, in the state of Andhra Pradesh, she is known as Jokulāmbikā, while in Tamil Nadu, she is commonly referred to as Kaṇṇakī. 

The worship of  Devī Durgā is so central to Indian culture that she has been depicted in a wide variety of creative styles across the country. This photo feature examines how Devī Durgā has been portrayed in a variety of Indian art forms, including the paṭṭacitrā of Bengal and Odisha, Pahāri painting, Rajasthani school, Himachali miniature painting, Deccan school, company school, and the legendary Raja Ravi Varma school.

#### Paṭṭacitrā of Bengal and Odisha

The presence of Devī Durgā are beautifully shown in the paṭṭacitrā, the traditional scroll art of Bengal and Odisha. These beautiful, vivid scrolls portray Durgā in her many forms, each one a representation of Her position as a fierce warrior Goddess, containing within her the power of all the Hindu gods combined. Paṭṭacitrā paintings are known for their attention to detail and bold use of color to portray the Divine Mother. 

#### Pahāri Paintings

Pahāri artists from Northern India give Devī Durgā a more tender and loving look. Pahāri artworks often feature the Goddess surrounded by ornate floral designs, signifying Her celestial beauty and elegance. Her calm appearance belies Her fierce personality, offering a fresh perspective on Devī Durgā's many facets.

#### Rajasthan School

The vibrant colors and detailed designs characteristic of Rajasthani art portray Devī Durgā as a formidable deity. As a sign of her bravery and might, She is frequently shown riding a lion or tiger in Her royal guise. The fierceness and splendor of Devī Durgā’s numerous arms are beautifully shown in the works of this school of Indian art.

#### Himachali Miniature Paintings

The complex intricacies and excellent brushwork of Himachali miniature paintings present a more polished image of Devī Durgā. The Goddess's nurturing and protective nature is reflected in Her peaceful appearance. These miniatures frequently feature Her surrounded by adoring followers, a testament to Her divine goodwill.

#### The Deccan School 

Devī Durgā is shown in a manner that is distinctive to the Deccan School, which combines Indian and Persian artistic traditions. The Goddess is typically depicted in a regal pose, adorned with ornate patterns and themes reminiscent of Persian art. Devī Durgā of the Deccan School is elegant and imperial.

#### Company School paintings

Colonial-era paintings from the Company School show a blending of European and Indian styles. The amalgamation of aesthetics depicts Devī Durgā as a symbol of cultural syncretism, and it serves to illustrate the evolution of art throughout the colonial era.

#### Raja Ravi Varma School

The work of Raja Ravi Varma, which includes depictions of Devī Durgā, is known for its realism and modernity. The Goddess in Ravi Varma's famous painting combines elements of both Western realism and traditional Indian art. These depictions of the goddess are more realistic, humanizing her so that she can speak to a wider audience without watering down her divine quality.

The portrayal of Devī Durgā in diverse kinds of Indian artwork serves as a testament to the multifaceted nature of Indian art and culture. Every regional school, including the paṭṭacitrā of Bengal and Odisha as well as the Raja Ravi Varma school, presents a distinct viewpoint on this revered deity. The artistic interpretations presented not only serve as a means of celebrating the divine, but also serve as a reflection of the ever-changing artistic sensibilities and cultural amalgamation that have played a significant role in shaping India's rich and dynamic artistic heritage throughout the course of history.
