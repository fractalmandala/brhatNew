[Vidyakshetra Vidyalaya](https://vidyakshetra.org/) is an Indic school and gurukula-based primary education establishment founded by [Śrī Muneet Dhiman](https://twitter.com/muneetdhiman). Located in Bengaluru, the school integrates Bhāratīya models of education and the Panchakoshatmika Vikas in its holistic curriculum. 

Muneet ji has developed an innovative pedagogy that ensures meaningful learning experiences for children. The education model connects bhāratīya kalās with experiential learning through a sustainable method, which also cultivates the culture of Samvāda. 

This year - as part of the geography and economics curriculums, students participated in an immersive learning experience by taking a Field Experience Trip to Odisha. They not only learned about geography and economy, but temples and architecture, history, craftsmanship, and sustainability.

Through this type of experiential and practical learning, the conventional ‘knowledge transfer’ goes from just the shallow data downloading to a deeper connection with the world we live in - empathy with it, and finally toward truth-seeking.

In part 1 of this series, we shared the beautiful [Student Diary](https://www.brhat.in/dhiti/vidyakshetra) capturing their reflections on the textiles, temples, and artcraft of the Utkala region. [Part 2](https://www.brhat.in/dhiti/vidyakshetra2) had the first formally written student report from the same trip. 

Here in Part 3, we share the final student report produced from the trip. Take a moment to enjoy our Odisha, from the eyes of the young and eager minds at Vidyakshetra.
