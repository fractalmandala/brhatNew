[Viyakshetra Vidyalaya](https://vidyakshetra.org/) is an Indic school and gurukula-based primary education establishment founded by Śrī Muneet Dhiman. Located in Bengaluru, the school integrates Bhāratīya models of education and the Panchakoshatmika Vikas in its holistic curriculum. 

The education provided to its students connects bhāratīya kalās with experiential learning in a sustainable method which also cultivates the culture of Samvāda.

This year, students participated in an immersive learning experience by taking a Field Experience Trip to Odisha. 

In the beautiful diary compiled below, they share their reflections on the textiles, temples, and artcraft of Utkala region.
