Among the many festivals that Manipuris celebrate throughout the year with joy and passion, **Ningol Chakouba**is one of the most important ones, especially for the Meitei community. This festival is dedicated to strengthening the bond between married women and their parental families. It is also assumed to be the biggest festival for the Ningols (women). 

The Ningol Chakouba festival is celebrated once a year in October - November, according to the Manipuri calendar on the second lunar day of the Heyangie month. Meiteis as well as some other communities of Manipur celebrate this festival with great fanfare. This festival is very similar to Rakshabandhan in its intent **Ningol means women and Chakouba means calling or inviting for a feast.**

On the day of Ningol Chakouba parents and/or brothers invite their married daughters, and their daughter’s children, to their homes for a special lunch, and offer gifts to them. On this day, married women come to their maternal homes from long distances to reinforce their relationship with their maternal family and recall lovely childhood memories. 


#### History 

Old historical records of Manipur throw light on this festival which was introduced during the reign of **Nongada Lairen Pakhangba**, though the manner in which it was celebrated then was slightly different. In the book, “_Pakhangba Nongkarol”,_ it is mentioned that Pakhangba had heard about a marching force led by Poireiton towards his Kingdom to which he was King. So he took charge and advanced ahead and met this force on the way. Poirei and Poireiton were defeated in battle and their Royal costumes were confiscated. Poireiton is said to have pretended to be dead knowing the supremacy of Pakhangba.

Meanwhile, Thongaren, the brother of Poireiton, visited Imphal valley. He came with his younger sister Laisana, who he proposed could be the Queen to Pakhangba. Hence Poireiton, Thongarel, and Laisana were reconciled to the then Kingdom of Kangla. Later, Poireiton became  a village chief. 

**Nongada Leiren Pakhangba married Laisana and ruled the Kingdom for 120 years. He appointed his wife as the Royal Queen of the Meiteis Kingdom.**

After the coronation of Laisana as Queen, she visited her brother Poireiton in order to observe the cultivation work of her brother and also to show her respect and gratitude. They were very delighted to meet each other after such a long time and made a commitment to meet again.

At the end of the meeting, Poreiton presented a very special paddy grain which was never seen before in the Meitei Kingdom. A small quantity of scented white paddy grain along with a small quantity of scented black-top paddy grain which is normally included in a Meitei religious feast, were offered as special gift items. He also offered some vegetables and fruits to his sister. 

After returning from her brother’s house, Queen Laisana cooked the scented rice with due care and offered it to her husband Nongada Lairen Pakhangba. The king was so overwhelmed with the taste of the rice that he named the rice as _Chakhao-Mon_. The black-top rice was named _Chakhao Poireiton_, in fond memory and gratitude to Poreiton.

Later, Laisana invited her brother Poireiton to a feast at her Palatial House where he was warmly hosted. Queen Laisana started a trend of inviting her brother to his sister’s home for a feast. Thus, this age old tradition of inviting brothers for a feast by their sisters was started. This festival is said to have started around the fourth century and was initially called **Piba Chakouba**, Piba means son.

In the nineteenth century King Chandrakriti found the task of visiting all his sisters’ homes in one day very difficult! **He started a new trend to invite all his sisters to his own home instead, hence Piba Chakouba became Ningol Chakouba in due course.**

#### IMPORTANCE OF THE CELEBRATION IN DELHI 


##### We believe that it is the culture, which conditions our attitude towards various issues such as religion, morality, marriage, science, family planning positions, and so on. Our attitude towards winning a race, understanding others, attaining freedom, being obedient to elders and teachers, being loyal, being patriotic etc., are all set forth by one’s culture. 

We are socialized on these models. 


#### ABOUT DELHI NINGOL CHAKOUBA ORGANIZING COMMITTEE 

A group of enthusiastic people from Manipur residing in Delhi – NCR with the help of a few civil society leaders started the Ningol Chakouba celebration in the National Capital Region (NCR) with a grand celebration six years back. Since then it has made history. 

The trustees of **United Living Trust** with its registered office at Patparganj, East Delhi, led by **Smt. Khulna Sahni**, one of the main functionaries, is supported by the Delhi Manipuris. The trust also runs a shelter in a rented accommodation in Kishan Garh, Vasant Kunj, South Delhi, where patients coming from Manipur and other parts of the North Eastern States are being provided with accommodation and other essential support during their medical treatment in Delhi, far away from home. Besides, they also conduct free medical check-ups and awareness camps, career counseling programs, coaching, and other important events from time to time.

Through this Trust, they showcase the richness of their unique and indigenous cultural heritage, and the embedded  values thereof. Via wide participation and interaction they hope to achieve the following perspectives: 

*  **The importance of Understanding Culture in Community Building**:  

    Understanding cultures will help us overcome and prevent racial and ethnic divisions. Racial and ethnic conflicts drain communities of financial and human resources; they distract cultural groups from concentrating on the key issues they have in common. 

*  **Building Relationships with people from Different Cultures**:

    Relationships are powerful. One-to-one connections or interactions are the foundation for change and in building relationships with people from different cultures. This is key in building diverse communities that are powerful enough to achieve significant goals. 

*  **Strategies and Activities for building strong relationship among ethnic groups**:  

    If we do not learn about the influences that cultural groups have had on our mainstream history and culture, we are all missing out on an accurate view of our society and our communities. Racial and ethnic divisions result in misunderstandings, loss of opportunities, and sometimes violence. 

This year Ningol Chakouba fell on November 15th 2023, but the United Living Trust did not organize any event, in solidarity with the many Meities, who have been rendered homeless due to the ongoing violence in the state of Manipur
