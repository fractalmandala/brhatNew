excerpt: "The construction of the models of mind and mental health from the Western paradigm is demonstrably incomplete, attempting symptomatic relief. This has led to the utter neglect of the inner world, self-awareness, experiential realities and insights from the Indic Knowledge Systems (such as Yoga, Vedānta, Āyurveda etc.)."
