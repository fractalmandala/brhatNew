From this side of the boat,
a city rises against the mist,

the eternal wanderer’s abode,
who holds the universe in his fist,

it has watched come and go,
the time wrapped around his wrist.

Many arrive here finally
and laugh at the abandoned list

of desires, regrets and sins.
The ones who persist,

know that the body stays here,
the river witnesses the tryst,

between the being and the becoming
of which everything and nothing exists.
