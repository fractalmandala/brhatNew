Bhagyanagar is very fortunate to be hosting a yajna (yagna) of this scale and intention. The **Bharata Bhagya Samriddhi Yagna** is being held at Sitaram Bagh Mandir from Oct 15-Nov 26, 2023,. _“Our country needs our prayers more than ever now - defence, industry, finance, education - our nation needs to grow and prosper, as also the people in it, this was the intention with which we conceived this on such a grand scale_, says Madhavi garu.

Financed for the most part by the Chairperson of Virinchi Hospitals, **Smt. Madhavi Latha Kompella**, this is a very fine effort undertaken by her along with **Lopamudra Charitable Trust and Lathama Foundation**, which have been serving people through Health Clinics, Medicine Distribution, Disaster Relief, Road Safety Campaigns, and Education for Girls. This yajna, after due consultation with traditional sampradāyas, especially under the guidance of **Purohit Sri Aripirala Sarath garu,** is designed as a manḍala of forty days,  to ignite the spirit of service, and to serve as a spark, in unifying people from all walks of life. 

A yajna done correctly leads to yogam, unity with the divine. While Rudra, Canḍi, Vārāhī, Pratyāngira,  are  the main deities towards whom the ritviks will be performing the traditional yajnas, grāma devatās i.e., village and local deities, will also be invoked to re-energize and protect our borders. On offer are arcanās, pārāyaṇams, kalyāṇams, kathās, samskāras, and pūjas, such as “.._Sitarama Kalyanam, Girija Kalyanam, Meenakshi Kalyanam, Sri Venkateswara Kalyanam, Goda Kalyanam, Vinayaka Kalyanam, Kartikeya Kalyanam, Rukmini Sri Krishna Kalyanam, Gauri Kalyanam, Virinchi Kalyanam, Lakshmi Narasimha Kalyanam, Komuravelli Mallanna Kalyanam, Namakarana, Aksharabhyasam, Godaanam, Satyanarayana Katha, .Gangotsvam and Ganga Aarati and more….”_

Unfortunately given the nature of our education and our entertainment, we have been taught to mock and deride rituals, to feel guilty when indulging in them. Our society wants us to be rational and logical, devoid of any mystery or poetry, it wants to sanitize us. Yet rituals are but external expressions of our subconscious desires, we ritualize our life to make meaning of it. There is a ritual for every act and every behaviour; from brushing our teeth to bathing, to cooking food to eating, from studying for exams to watching a TV drama, where and when have we stopped ritualizing? 

**A series of acts, performed in a specific manner to produce optimum results and also designed to give satisfaction is a ritual**. Rituals are not dogma as we have been spoonfed since childhood. Definitely not the rituals which are prescribed in the karma kāṇḍa of the Vedas, when done with śraddhā, and in an appropriate manner as required by the śāstra, they give the very results that we humans seek: artha, kāma, dharma, all this is taken care of. As long as people are in samsāra and want to enjoy the benefits, as honest hard working people following dharma, where is the problem? Why should it dampen anyone’s spirits?

Local artists and traditional practitioners of malla yuddham (combat wrestling), karra & katti sāmu (stick & sword fighting) are also slated to showcase their vidyās here, whilst art forms such as hari kathā, burra kathā, uggu kathā which glorify our heroes and warriors via storytelling will get a chance to perform too. Daily feeding of the devotees continues as **nitya annadānam & mahā prasādam** is also being offered. **Bhajan sessions** every evening at 6.30 pm are another great draw.

This is the first time that **45 priests** who have attained mantra siddhis (those who have completed an appropriate number of chants in a prescribed manner as required by one’s guru or sacred texts) have been brought together from across the country and are performing a variety of yajnas, **38 distinct vaidika rituals** in all, for the benefit of our nation, for Bharat. Individuals may also perform these yajnas by requesting the same for a small fee. The parṇaśālā where the yajna is being performed has been built without using any metal at all, reminding us of bygone times. The purohits stay in the temple premises for the said period, and have devoted their all to making this yajna beneficial and fruitful for all, for loka kalyāṇam.

This yajna is being conducted in Goshamahal, this area and its neighbourhoods of Dhoolpet, Afzal Gunj, Sultan Bazaar, and Moazzam Jahi Market, are not very developed as compared to the rest of the twin cities. Over the years, some areas have unfortunately become difficult for locals to visit as they do not offer much in terms of entertainment or education.

Historically speaking  Goshamahal houses the **Goshamahal Baradari**, a palace built by the last Qutub Shahi ruler, Sultan Abul Hassan Tana Shah in 1684, before Aurangzeb laid siege and installed his son Shah Alam. This then became the Mughal headquarters in the South. Later Mir Osman Ali Khan, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, handed it over to the Freemasons, who continue to be the caretakers of this palace, calling it the Freemasons' Hall. 

This constituency is unique for the Member of Parliament (MP) and the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) that it has elected. On one hand we have **Asaduddin Owaisi of the AIMIM as the MP**, while **T. Raja Singh from the BJP is the MLA**, both representing Goshamahal. 

Keeping the history, geography, and politics of this place in mind, the presence of a beautiful old Hindu temple called the **Sitaram Bagh Mandir** built by Seth Puranmal Ganeriwala, spread over 25 acres and classified as a **heritage building by INTACH** (Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage), becomes very important. That this temple continues to find patrons via its trustees and the few odd devotees is quite a blessing. Once a stronghold of Northern Indians who found employment in the city during the era of the Nizam’s, this area has now been abandoned and many have moved towards Gachibowli and beyond.

Thus it becomes all the more imperative that we in Bhagyanagar avail of this great opportunity to participate in such an enterprising endeavour which brings together not just puṇḍits from all over the country, but also encourages people from all walks of life to reconnect to their heritage in such an unlikely consecrated space. Be sure to participate in these age old rituals in large numbers, for the welfare of our country, our society, and our families.

Next to the **gośālā** of this temple is the Śiva temple under the same trustee, with a vast open space, it is here that the yajna is being conducted. **Daily Live Stream** may be accessed [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/-Yj5MrNtqXk). Those interested in registering for the pūjās, homams and kalyāṇams, may please contact; bbsyagna23@gmail.com or call **7337323960.** A list of acceptable items for donations is hung at the entrance, this is a people’s yajna, hence our participation is a must!
