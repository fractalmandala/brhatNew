[Vidyakshetra Vidyalaya](https://vidyakshetra.org/) is an Indic school and gurukula-based primary education establishment founded by [Śrī Muneet Dhiman](https://twitter.com/muneetdhiman). Located in Bengaluru, the school integrates Bhāratīya models of education and the Panchakoshatmika Vikas in its holistic curriculum. 

Muneet ji has developed innovative pedagogies that allow for a meaningful learning experience for children. The education model connects bhāratīya kalās with experiential learning through a sustainable method, which also cultivates the culture of Samvāda. 

This year - as part of the geography and economics curriculums, students participated in an immersive learning experience by taking a Field Experience Trip to Odisha. They not only learned about geography and economy, but temples and architecture, history, craftsmanship, and sustainability.

Through this type of experiential and practical learning, the conventional ‘knowledge transfer’ goes from shallow data downloading to a deeper connection with the world we live in, empathy with it, and finally toward truth-seeking.

In part 1 of this series, we shared the beautiful [Student Diary](https://www.brhat.in/dhiti/vidyakshetra) capturing their reflections on the textiles, temples, and artcraft of the Utkala region. 

Here in this second instalment, we share one formally written report from the same trip.
