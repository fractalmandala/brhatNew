excerpt: "The pancākṣara of Bhagavān Śiva is a mahāmantra composed of five letters: Na-Ma-Śi-Vā-Ya. These five letters denote the five actions or pañca-kṛtyam of the Bhagvān Śiva: Sṛṣṭi (creation), Sthiti (preservation), Saṃhāra (destruction), Tirodhāna (veiling), Anugraha (blessing). These five aspects are captured beautifully in Pañcamukha Śiva, the five-fold faces of Bhagavān Śiva."

In the dhārmika fold, every form and expression of the divine can be understood in at least four different standpoints: the absolute, the cosmic, the departmental, and as the incarnation who appeared on earth to re-establish dharma. From the highest, absolute standpoint, Bhagavān Śiva is the formless, absolute Reality, which is the nature of pure Consciousness. He is no different than Śrī Viṣṇu Himself. From the cosmic standpoint, Bhagavān Śiva represents the Lord of the universe. He is creator, sustainer, and destroyer of the world. From the departmental, governance standpoint He is worshiped as the deity in charge of destruction, the process without which there can be no creation. In His fourth aspect, avatāra, He has multiple forms that manifested on earth. He is said to have appeared in several incarnations as Guru, teaching knowledge of the Self to his disciples. Dakṣiṇāmurti Bhagavān, Śrī Ādi Śaṅkarācārya, and Śrī Hanumān are considered some incarnations of Bhagavān Śiva. 

The name Śiva means auspiciousness, and Śaṅkara, from śam karoti iti, the one who brings or does goodness, auspiciousness. Regarding upāsanā on Bhagavān Śiva, Swami Sivananda elucidates - 

>Repetition of the hymns to Śiva strengthens the good saṃskāras. As a man thinks, that he becomes. This is the psychological law. The mind of a man who trains himself in thinking good, holy thoughts, develops a tendency to think good thoughts. His character is molded and transformed by continued good thought. When the mind thinks of the image of the Lord during His hymns, the mental substance actually assumes the form of the image of the Lord. The impression of the object is left in the mind. This is called saṃskāra. When the act is repeated very often, the saṃskāras gain strength by repetition, and a tendency or habit is formed in the mind. He who entertains thoughts of Divinity becomes transformed actually into the Divinity himself by constant thinking. His bhāva or disposition is purified and divinised.

The pañcākṣara of Bhagavān Śiva is a mahāmantra composed of five letters: Na-Ma-Śi-Vā-Ya. These five letters denote the five actions or pañcakṛtyam of the Lord, being sṛṣṭi (creation), sthiti (preservation), saṃhāra (destruction), tirodhāna (veiling) and anugraha (blessing). These five aspects are captured beautifully in Pañcamukha Śiva, the five-fold faces of Bhagavān Śiva.
