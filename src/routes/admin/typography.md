This document is a living reference sheet for all rules, guidelines, open points and ongoing issues for the typography on Bṛhat website in general, and on Dhīti in detail. The guidelines in broad:

##### 1. We represent Sanskrit words in their IAST forms (see below).
##### 2. For quoting other writers/authors within an essay, we represent the quotes EXACTLY as they are found. That is, if the quoted text does not use IAST, then we do not diacritize it either.
##### 3. In general, all links within a post should open in a new tab. 
##### 4. All writers should familiarize themselves with IAST, and implement it in their submissions. While we proofread all posts, we do not diacritize on behalf of writers.
##### 5. Writers must share the specific image(s) to use with their article IN THE SUBMISSION MAIL. That is, NOT ONLY AS inserted images within the article document. Images should be authorized for use/we should own the permission or rights to use them. 
##### 6. The hero image for a post must be in 1200 x 630 dimension (done by poster, not writer), and this plus any other images should all be in .webp format. 
##### 7. The recommended location for all article Google Documents is [this shared folder.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hj763vEa-__O2649T0ZO96jJqnaqdonj?usp=sharing). 

### Submission Rules
- An article is not ready for posting unless the writer has resolved/closed all comments and suggestions on the source Google Document.
- An article is not ready for posting unless the hero and any other relevant images have been shared via email, and they are all authorized for usage.
- An article must be submitted in the writer's best, error-free, IAST-compliant output. Bṛhat will run it through a round of proof-reading, but writers must submit grammatically/lexically sound pieces. 
- Bṛhat-external writers must share a Twitter handle if they have one and if they are open to be tagged. If they do not want to be tagged, they MUST volunteer this info.
- It is preferred that the writer share a draft for a less than 200-character tweet, or a thread of no more than 3 tweets, for posting their article on Twitter.
- Editors must share all requisites above with the poster.

### Diacritics
For all usage of Sanskrit words on the website, and especially in Dhīti posts, we follow the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration system containing characters with diacritic marks, such as- ā, ṛ, ḥ. Some relevant links:
- About IAST - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration)
- Basic Converter - [YesVedanta](https://www.yesvedanta.com/transliterate/)

###### There are some exceptions to the above rule:
1. We do NOT diacritize the colloquial or modern proper nouns. For example, names of recent/contemporary personalitieis- Ram Swarup (and not Rāma Svarūpa); or of locations and temples- Ayodhya, Jagannath Mandir, etc.
2. We do NOT diacritize inside of quotes of other writers/authors. Quotes are always represented exactly as they are found.

###### Open Issues
- What about any non-Sanskrit Indian language?

###### General Terms
- We do NOT diacritize Hindi words. 

### Images
All hero images must be in 1200 x 630 resolution. Easy tools to crop/resize images are Canva, Figma or online sites like [this](https://picresize.com/en/edit). 
These and any other image must be in .webp compressed form. Generally, an image should not be more than around 100-150kb in size.
The ideal storage place for all images is [this Supabase storage bucket](https://app.supabase.com/project/rnfvzaelmwbbvfbsppir/storage/buckets/brhatwebsite), but one can use any public image storage solution. All image links should end in .webp ( or .png/.jpg/.jpeg at minimum.)
