This document is a living reference sheet for all rules, guidelines, open points and ongoing issues for the typography on Bṛhat website in general, and on Dhīti in detail. The guidelines in broad:

##### 1. We represent Sanskrit words in their IAST forms (see below).
##### 2. For quoting other writers/authors within an essay, we represent the quotes EXACTLY as they are found. That is, if the quoted text does not use IAST, then we do not diacritize it either.
##### 3. In general, all links within a post should open in a new tab. 
##### 4. All writers should familiarize themselves with IAST, and implement it in their submissions. While we proofread all posts, we do not diacritize on behalf of writers.
##### 5. Writers must share the specific image(s) to use with their article IN THE SUBMISSION MAIL. That is, NOT ONLY AS inserted images within the article document. Images should be authorized for use/we should own the permission or rights to use them. 
##### 6. The hero image for a post must be in 1200 x 630 dimension (done by poster, not writer), and this plus any other images should all be in .webp format. 

### Diacritics
For all usage of Sanskrit words on the website, and especially in Dhīti posts, we follow the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration system containing characters with diacritic marks, such as- ā, ṛ, ḥ. Some relevant links:
- About IAST - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration)
- Basic Converter - [YesVedanta](https://www.yesvedanta.com/transliterate/)

###### There are some exceptions to the above rule:
1. We do NOT diacritize the colloquial or modern proper nouns. For example, names of recent/contemporary personalitieis- Ram Swarup (and not Rāma Svarūpa); or of locations and temples- Ayodhya, Jagannath Mandir, etc.
2. We do NOT diacritize inside of quotes of other writers/authors. Quotes are always represented exactly as they are found.

###### Open Issues
- What about any non-Sanskrit Indian language?

###### General Terms
- We do NOT diacritize Hindi words.
