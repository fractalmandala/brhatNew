These questions are intended as a sample of things to reflect on for a session in unstructured introspection. We do not approach them as a checklist, or as a set where each question must be answered. Rather these lay out a broad template that shows routes to take when identifying one's location and positioning. 

###### A. What is the **core** intent behind this design?
It is helpful to reflect on this by a process of elimination. That is, by identifying elements that are certainly NOT a core intent of the design. 

###### B. What elements of our **personal ontology** are salient for this project?

###### C. Are there any obvious dissonances in our plan? 

###### D. Prakriyā - visualize the processess and methodologies we see this project requiring.

###### E. Upakaraṇa - create a mental list of the tools and utilities that we will need for this design. Are they of the reuse type, are there new needs?

###### F. Vyavahāra - take stock of the conduct, behaviour and interactions in your last project. What development journey are you already on, or what new dimension is apparent?

###### G. What is the prime personal intent in this design? Which quality could we assign to it?

As a whole, these questions help us get a sense of how we qualify things, that is- what is good or bad, desirable or undesirable, necessary or ancilliary, well thought-through or done-by-repetitions, etc. Doing so gives us the shape and form of our intent, purpose and role. 

The same exercise can then be done iteratively at different stages, to increasing detail or resolution. In consequent rounds we sharpen our answers, which begins by deriving close-ended forms of the above open-ended queries. We give a general description, and then look at some examples.
