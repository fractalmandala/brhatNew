As a designer intiates a design journey then, as the svataḥ-siddha, she begins at the stage of 'preparation.' It is where we design to identify the broadest possible surface area of our:

1. icchā - will, intent, desire, need
2. bhāva - feeling, emotion, dispassion, disposition
3. jñāna - knowledge, ontological base
4. yogyatā - readiness, capability

And we wish to do so with our platform the Dhāmika worldview, our critera for 'good' or 'bad', for 'desirable' or 'good-to-have,' for what to 'optimize' for, for what a 'user empathy' should strive towards, and more, informed by a 'moral base' rooted to our inherited wisdom. In itself, the recognition that a fundamental recalibration is needed at all levels of design, is not unique to our system. Wherever sincere inquiries on the modern condition have been conduction, conclusions similar to ours have been arrived at. For example what the Center for Humane Technology states is the fundamental wicked problem of our times by quoting Dr. EO Wilson- 

> "The real problem of humanity is the following: We have Paleolithic emotions, medieval institutions and godlike technology."

Which is another way of saying that we have acquired the power of gods, without the commensurate wisdom needed to wield it. The Center for Humane Technology's mission then is understandable and compelling- "to shift technology towards a more humane future that supports our well-being, democratic functioning, and shared information environment." They back this lucidly articulated problem statement with a body of research and recommendations on things ranging from "the alarm on catastrophic effects of runaway technology" and "ledger of harms" to "areas where technology is harming future generations" and "solutions for technologists, for parents, for policymakers." They also extend a course on foundations of humane technology, for "professionals, with or without a technical background, shaping tomorrow's technology," completely free.

What becomes evident with such voices is that our current criteria and methods to establish intent, the initial design brief, the user targets, the harm reduction and more are inadequate. And in the era of "runaway technology" such lacunae carry exponentially more risk. This established as a central premise to our paradigm as well, we can explore methods to bridge the gaps. More specifically, since ours is a ṛta in design, we use ṛta as the core module, the building block. We do so through the following framework for a mental positioning.

### Cosmogony - A Paradigm for Origin
It is borne from *sat*, the eternal
