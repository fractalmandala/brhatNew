#### Design

To design is to create with intent, deliberation, plan and purpose; Design is the implementation of a process with reflection-in-action. Design involves creating, constructing, conceptualising, planning, framing of intent and navigation of constraining boundaries.

#### Dharma

To establish, to practice a method or custom, to organize life and society in consonance with the natural flow is to establish dharma. That which is created with intent, deliberation, plan, purpose and reflection-in-action is dharma. Dharma is the dynamic cultural process of bearing and supporting a tradition of deliberate and planned consonance with the harmonics of reality.

In the distant past…
The sound instruments of mental scientists converted information to knowledge,
And engineers of praxis and ritual converted knowledge to utility.
Dharma is the conversion and manifestation of utility in the cultural context, ie.:

#### Dharma IS Design

And what is dharma, if not the endeavor to conduct life and society in consonance with ṛta, the natural order? To bring dharma in design is to bring a ṛta-consciousness to the processes and methods of design. Dharma in design is effectively, Ṛta in Design.

Ṛta in Design is our input at seed and root- at the very intent, reflection, planning and implementing of those that craft our world. It synthesizes key aspects of the dhārmika worldview and links it to general steps in the contemporary design process. This makes it possible for designers to use the fundamentals coded in the cultural identity of our grand civilization.

#### What Do We Call Design?

Firing up a search for the Sanskrit translation of ‘design’ will yield a list of words as disparate as anusaṃdhāna, anubandha, cikīrṣita, mantra and more. When we understand design to be a process of deliberation and reflection-in-action that ends with an implementation, it should not be surprising that a culture built upon deliberation to everything should throw up so many options for the word ‘design.’ It should in fact make sense that a syntactically deliberate instrument of mind- mantra- is also a design.

What this gets at is the subtle but profound difference between creating and designing, as understood by the dhārmika mind. In this framework the matter always begins with the agent- the doer. Whether it is creation or design, it is something the doer does. All of reality is artifacts of the mind manifest through an agent’s will, and so the Sanskrit root of √kṛ (कृ) which means ‘to do,’ takes center-stage.

This is as true at the level of grammar as it is on the level of ontology- karma is one of the strongest binding operators in ṛta under the dhārmika worldview. Without action there would be no reality, and reality itself is understood as “coming into being,” or bhavati- happens, becomes.

To ‘design something’ most accurately means to do it with a process of deliberation and planning, through an outcome of deep-thinking, reflection and crystallization of intent. In other words, design is action when done by a self-reflective consciousness. Dhārmika design thinking requires that we realize that every action, every deed ought to be by design. What is done or accomplished through such a process is consequently “well-done,” or “well-effected,” “refined.” **There is a word to describe exactly this.**

##### Since it is done, it is a ‘kṛta’ (has been done), and since it is well done, it is ‘samyak.’ Well designed and well effected is thus something that is ‘saṃskṛta.’ The genuine word for design is saṃskaraṇa, and design as the output is saṃskṛti. 

One must take pause to internalize the implications:

- Whenever designers encounter skeptics to the claim that design impacts culture, they ought to be pointed to Indian culture, where the word for design and culture is in fact the same. They are both ‘saṃskṛtis’. Indian culture is the perfected design of our civilization.
- The process of design is samṣkaraṇa, and designers are would-be saṃskartṛs. What is well designed and perfected enough to be seeded through the culture is thus called saṃskāra - great designs.

Modern design aspires to be a reflection of nature. To be in perfect harmony with it. To respect through man-made design the perfected designs of reality. This is not the first instance of such a drive in our species. Thousand of years ago there were people that understood nature as prakṛti - the original or preceding design- and had the imperative to be in harmony with is as cardinal principle of their own design- their saṃskṛti.

Under this light, ‘dhārmika design thinking‘ is arguably a redundancy of articulation. If dharma is design as we’ve established, then what does design of design thinking mean? Designers will be the first to confess- it means quite a bit. It is why a book titled ‘Design of Design’ makes sense. There is always a process to even ‘doing’ the process; a way of working behind a way that is working, a pra-kriyā before the kriyā. This is bound to happen when what we speak of involves continuous self-reflection or ping-back. This ping-back, or cintana, is what design seeks to shape over the long term.
