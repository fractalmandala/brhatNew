“It is time we talk of the unspoken truth between us, my friend,” said Maharshi Vishvamitra, his eyes radiating with deep perception and wisdom.  

	Kanaka knew what Vishvamitra referred to, and silently agreed.  He knew the truth for many years now- it was not difficult to put one and one together, and deduce his Kaushika’s true identity.  “I have always felt that the truth would come out between us when the time is right,” said Kanaka.  “And I think it is.  You have invited me deep into Bharatvarsha, and now you ask me to go deeper still.  It is better that there are no more secrets between us.”

	“Indeed,” said Vishvamitra, his tone sagely and measured.  “I came to Mulyasthana as Kaushika, a simple trader from Kanyakubja.  Only two details were ever true- my name, and my city.  But in what I now think was a remarkable feat of foresight from my younger self, I did not disclose my true identity.  It has kept me safe all these years, and I have been able to help the Dasa-Druhyus far better this way.  For I am in fact from the royal Bharata family, dear Kanaka.  My father was King Gathin, born in the line of the Kushambha Bharatas of Kaushambhi and Kanyakubja.  At the age of seventeen, I was exiled for twenty years- and I came to Mulyasthana after spending many years in Varanavati, Haradvara and Kurukshetra.”

	Kanaka’s expression remained steady.  Vishvamitra’s confession was on the lines of what he thought he knew all this time.  His proud, almost arrogant friend had always displayed the traits of royalty.  Now it added to his stature- not only was he a Maharshi, but he was one from the royal Bharata family.  Even the Kashi Rajarshis never achieved that ranking.  But one matter had troubled his mind all these years, even without this knowledge, and he posed it now to Vishvamitra.  “Why help us then?”  He asked.  “Why have you given yourself to the Dasas and Druhyus, and now to the Purus?”

	The Maharshi smiled, and it was a benign look starkly different to the clumsy grin of erstwhile Kaushika.  “You call me Vishvamitra, and yet you ask me this question.  My engagement with the Veda has taught me a few simple things.  No dogma, no discrimination, no intolerance and no violence.  Equality, unity and respect- these are the essential truths in life- and the only things I give my alliance to.  When my family goes against this grain, I cannot find support with them.”

	Kanaka smiled as if he was blessed with sacred knowledge, such was the aura of sincerity emanate from Vishvamitra’s words.  “When does your period of exile end?”  He asked.

	“It ended two years ago,” Vishvamitra replied.  “And scouts sent by my family search for me in Bharatvarsha and beyond.  That is why we must go to Kaushambhi, for I intend to finally return.  I have tried rallying the Dasas and Druhyus together, I have tried organizing them into fighting units capable of taking on the Bharata soldiers.  But those attempts are failing, and you know this as well.  Our irregular, faint attempts cannot match the Bharatas’ growing power.  My only hope was in the Purus, but King Divodasa has negated that danger as well- even if briefly.  I am compelled to try a different approach- that of reason.  I will talk to my brother, King Vishvaratha, and see if I can convince him to make Divodasa cease his aggressions.”

	“I do not see why I will be needed there,” Kanaka said somewhat cautiously.  

	Vishvamitra widened his eyes in mock surprise.  “You are my dearest friend, Kanaka.  The journey from Ahikshetra to Kaushambhi is long, and I do not want to make it alone.  Your company will be delightful along the way, and it will be especially needed if Vishvaratha rejects my plea, and we are forced to leave in a hurry.  Come now, do not pretend that you have never harboured aspirations to travel the length of Bharatvarsha.”

***

Kanaka’s eyes were never bombarded with so many strange sights.  He constantly turned his head left to right, always sighting something new and curious.  Vishvamitra smiled at his friend- Kanaka was indeed a foreigner in Bharatvarsha.  “I never knew there were so many people in your land,” he said, awed.

	“Wait till you see Kanyakubja and Kaushambhi,” Vishvamitra said, still smiling.  The journey from Ahikshetra to Nandigrama was conducted by river, by taking a boat downstream along the Gomati river.  Nandigrama was to the Bharatas what Govanda was to the Suryavansha- a large, sprawling cattle farm with thousands of cows, oxen, buffalos and even goats and sheep.  It was also a crowded, bustling marketplace.  Farmers and metal-smiths from villages all along the Gomati came to Nandigrama to trade their produce with merchants from the cities of Kanyakubja, Kampilya, and Vatsa.  

	Nandigrama and Kanyakubja were connected by a wide, paved highway that continued from the latter in either direction to Kampilya or Prayaga.  The highway was busy early in the morning, with carts supplying fresh milk, grain and vegetables for the day’s first trading session.  “Your family rules all this,” Kanaka mused, finally seeing what his friend had sacrificed for the sake of Dasas and Druhyus.

	“Not this really,” Vishvamitra corrected.  “My brother rules Kanyakubja, but all the land around it belongs to King Pijavana- our cousin.  This highway was constructed and is maintained by his line.”

	“Why not have one King?”  Kanaka asked.  “Why have four that can disagree with each other, and even come into conflict?”

	“There is no real answer to that.  I personally feel that the Suryavanshi way of primogeniture is best.  It has ensured their survival for close to a thousand years, despite all their enemies.  But the Bharata way of multiple Kings is what we seek to exploit now, so we should not really complain.”

	Kanaka chuckled dryly, his eyes going to the travelers that passed them by.  Vishvamitra seemed much more the native here than he did in Mulyasthana.  His black hair, brown eyes and skin were right in place, and there were no men of orange hair or burnt, copper skin.  He saw now why Vishvamitra wanted him for company- the Maharshi would look much more the outsider with Kanaka beside him, and not a returning Prince.

	“Indra rules here,” Kanaka commented aloud.  “Indra powers the warriors of this land.  Indra destroyed Harayupa and Mulyasthana.”

	“The Devas would scoff at our mundane affairs,” Vishvamitra replied.  “Their natural order exists at a much higher realm of relevance and meaning.  Do not make the mistake of associating Devas with the actions of humans, my friend.  That would make us no different than the Bharata rshis and priests.  Have you not heard their latest ballads, conveniently inserted into the Veda?”

	Kanaka nodded and recited, “In aid of Abhyavartin Chayamana, Indra destroyed the seed of Varasikha.  At Harayupa he smote the vanguard of the Dasas, and the rear fled frightened.”

	“Abhyavartin Chayamana- Crown Prince Mitrayu’s official title, given to him by his grandfather,” said Vishvamitra cynically.  “The Bharata priests would have us believe that Indra himself rides with their Kings.  But then, the Vasishtha School has always been good on propaganda.”

	Kanaka said nothing, feeling lost amid Bharatvarsha’s ruling and priestly clans.  His life back home was far simpler, but it existed no more.  He was destined to aid Vishvamitra forever, Kanaka knew that in his heart.  He was silent for most of the journey to Kanyakubja after that, and the many sights and sounds of Bharatvarsha kept him occupied while Vishvamitra whisked him from Kanyakubja to Kaushambhi- ruling seat of King Vishvaratha.  This was where power resided, and Kanaka knew that he walked into the city with a man who stood at the top of the social pyramid.  

***

They managed to get to Kaushambhi without too many stares, but Vishvamitra was recognized almost immediately once they entered the city.  Or rather ‘Prince Kaushika’ was, for that was the name the residents of Kaushambhi chimed.  Merchants stopped their trading, farmers put sales on hold and watched him walk by- the exiled prince of Kaushambhi had not been forgotten by his subjects- even after twenty-two long years!  Kanaka wondered how Vishvamitra managed to look like his younger self even now, before reminding himself that his subject was a Maharshi, after all.  A few men walked up and fell at his feet.  “We are blessed, great Prince!”  One of them exclaimed as Kaushika pulled them up.  “How long have we waited for your return!”

	Kaushika hugged each of them in turn.  “I am humbled by your love, my friends,” he said- but Kanaka noticed that this was not a benevolent Maharshi talking to them.  This was a learned, trained royal scion- a man who knew how to wield and reciprocate the well-wishes of his denizens.  Kanaka had a vision of lost opportunity- of the ruler Kaushika could have been without his exile and subsequent rshi-hood.  

	The hugs and greetings continued all the way to the royal compounds- nestled between a few knolls at the city’s southern end.  “One does not often find two cities so close to each other,” Kanaka commented, knowing that it spoke of the Bharatas’ great prosperity that the land could support both Kaushambhi and Prayaga.

	Vishvamitra nodded in agreement.  It was remarkable how he switched between the guises of prince and Maharshi.  When he spoke to the citizens, his eyes were of steel and his tone commanding; when he spoke to Kanaka, the eyes were moist with wisdom and the tone sagely.  “The wealth and power of Prayaga were too great to be contained in one city,” he said.  “But there are other reasons as well.  Even within us Bharatas, there are different lines, with varying degrees of separation from the prime line of First King Bharata.  Prayaga has always been under the prime line, and the others have to defer to its authority.”

	“But your family did not,” Kanaka said, guessing the history behind Kaushambhi.

	“After a while,” Vishvamitra said.  “For generations we lived in Kanyakubja- the only city descended to Jahnu, second of King Bharata’s three grandsons.  But things changed during the times of King Tritsu and Kushambha.  Tritsu was of the prime line, and Kushambha from Jahnu’s.  King Tritsu’s sons were many, and his family grew large- enough for them to begin calling themselves the Tritsu Bharatas.  Their power and authority in Prayaga grew too much for Kushambha, and he migrated his entire family away to found a new town.  Kaushambhi is thus named in his honour.”

	“And are the Tritsus and Kushambhas still in conflict?”

	“Not really.  The Tritsus split into further lines themselves, spawning the Kings that now control all of north Bharatvarsha.  But our rivalries are only petty, dear Kanaka.  We are united by a strong bond of ancestry and common history.”

	“Do I detect a note of pride there, Maharshi?”

	“Why not?”  Vishvamitra countered.  “Our present crimes do not negate our glorious history.  Bharatvarsha is where the Veda has been collated, where the greatest Rajarshis of Kashi have discovered the most esoteric of hymns and sciences.  It is the Kingdom that invented the chariot and the Ashvamedha, and built the most glorious cities Aryavarta has ever seen.  I do not side with the Dasas without grief and conflict, Kanaka.”

***

“You must be ready,” Vishvamitra said to Kanaka.  “My brother may not take to my return too kindly.  Primogeniture is not law among us, and I have technically as much right to the throne as Vishvaratha.  He may take me as nothing more than a political rival.  If things go awry, I want you to make way for Subhumika right away.  The Puru princes Bheda and Shimyu are hidden there.  Keep them safe.”

	Kanaka did not really believe Vishvaratha would find his brother so threatening.  But he nodded nevertheless.  Knowing Vishvamitra’s true lineage only added to his aura and command.  Kanaka was already surrendered to the Maharshi, now he obeyed the royal Prince as well.  He followed Vishvamitra into the royal hall, where the large, tall and grim men of Kaushambhi were seated upon elevated platforms.  Giant sculptures and busts were carved into the walls- figures of past rulers and founders.  Gold gleamed from within nooks and pockets- subtlety seemed to be the philosophy of Kushambha architecture.  Kanaka had heard of the opulence of Kashi, and he imagined this to be its opposite in a manner of speaking.  

	There were three men seated on the platform, and the man in the center sat on a large, gold plated throne.  This was King Vishvaratha- second son of late King Gathin.  He observed his exiled brother approach, eyes betraying no emotion.  But the older man next him jumped down the platform, even with his limp.  He rushed towards Vishvamitra and pulled him into a tight embrace.  “Kaushika!”  The man exclaimed.  “When word reached us that you were spotted in the city, I could scarcely believe it.”

	Kaushika returned the hug with equal sincerity, and there was a true, pleased look in his eyes when he addressed the man.  “I apologize for the years of delay, brother Putakritu.  Though you have not been sitting idly!  I hear of scouts out in the land, looking for me.  Your doing, no doubt?”

	“Enemies of the Bharata grow by the day,” shouted King Vishvaratha from his throne.  “We were concerned that you might have been taken captive.”  There was no softness in the King’s eyes, nothing to hint that he was pleased at the sight of his brother.  

	Putakritu nodded.  “But you are back, that is all that matters.”  Then his eyes turned to Kanaka.

	“This is Rshi Kanaka,” Kaushika introduced.  “He has been my ally for many long years, a fellow traveler in my exiles.”	

	Putakritu bowed and folded his hands in a namaskara.  “The halls of Kaushambhi are rarely visited by a rshi,” he said.  “Especially since Kaushika’s exile.”

	At King Vishvaratha’s signal, attendants walked in with water and refreshments.  Kaushika and Kanaka were led to some cushioned seats by the throne, where their feet were washed with scented water.  King Vishvaratha looked on with cold, emotionless eyes.  Putakritu continued to ask after his brother’s exile.  

	“Easy, brother,” Vishvamitra said gently, a beaming smile upon his face.  “There is much time to share my tale, and more still to hear yours in turn.  But first I must make council with the King.”

	Kanaka turned to Vishvaratha, and even now the King’s face was expressionless and unreadable.  A corner of his loyal heart bristled with annoyance.  Maharshi Vishvamitra was no man to stare down at, and yet King Vishvaratha looked at him with something bordering disdain.  But these men were brothers, born and brought up together till Vishvamitra was exiled.  Was there no love between them, no fond memories of time spent together?

	Putakritu frowned.  Clearly he was not enjoying Kaushika’s less than warm return.  He looked from one brother to another, trying to read the silent battle playing out between their gazes.  “Enough!” He finally said, and the invisible cord of tension broke.  The eldest son of Gathin was stamping his authority now, and it did not matter who was King.  

“Kaushika, you return to us after twenty year years.  This is a time of tension and war, and your whereabouts have been unknown to us.  This is the reason for Vishvaratha’s cool, distant demeanour.  But you return to us with a stranger in tow, at a moment that you know our family has been awaiting for two decades.  I mean no offence to you, Rshi Kanaka, but Kaushika is out of place to bring you into the royal halls.”  Putakritu was not raging, he spoke in a loud, measured tone- the tone of a patriarch who wielded complete control over the affairs of his family.  He turned to his returning brother.  “And now you wish to address the King?  What of your mother, who has seen her husband die and her youngest son overstay his exile?  What of your sisters, some of whom now reside elsewhere with their husbands?  Will you not ask of our father, of how he died?”

	There was no defiance in Vishvamitra’s eyes, but no concession either.  “As you rightly said, brother, this is a time of tension and war.  I have been in places where our armies have not, heard things ours spies may have missed.  Once I have shared these with the King, I will hear of our father and his demise.  I will go to mother and regale her with tales of my exile.  I will even visit our sisters in Vatsa and Kampilya.”

	Kanaka had to struggle to prevent himself from cheering.  He saw it now- Putakritu and Vishvaratha remembered Kaushika- their youngest brother and youngest even of the family.  They were used to his unquestioning obedience and adherence to the family protocols.  But they were strangers to Maharshi Vishvamitra, to his radiating power and arrogant defiance.  Vishvamitra was not denying Putakritu’s authority, but he was not surrendering to it either.  

	“Let him speak, brother,” King Vishvaratha said finally, and now there was the hint of amusement in his eyes.  “I am curious to see what my brother knows that my spies do not.  What lands has he stepped foot on, where even the combined armies of Bharatvarsha have not roamed?”

	Vishvamitra nodded.  “Brother Putakritu is right however, that I was wrong to bring Rshi Kanaka to a personal, family event.  I have spent many years in the company of strangers and transitory friends, and Rshi Kanaka’s company is one that I take for granted.”  Vishvamitra turned to Kanaka and signaled with his eyes.  “Rshi Kanaka, perhaps you would like to explore some of Kaushambhi’s temples, or even take rest in the royal guest quarters?”

	Kanaka understood.  Vishvamitra had sensed enough hostility in the hall to feel reason for alarm.  Kanaka was to set off for Subhumika immediately.  In the hitherto unlikely, but now dangerously possible event that Vishvamitra did not return, the care of Bheda and Shimyu Puru would fall to him.

***

“What do you know of this Maharshi Vishvamitra?”  King Vishvaratha asked.  

	“Nothing more than what you may know already,” Vishvamitra replied, uncomfortably aware of Putakritu’s piercing gaze upon him.  “He is most likely a warrior-priest from some western Dasa city.  He is a capable commander and shrewd strategist.  But he also seems to know much about the Bharata ways and military tactics.”   

	“Which rules out some western Dasa city as his place of origin,” said Vishvaratha instantly.  “Our reports of his appearance, his speech and even his past whereabouts suggest that Vishvamitra may well be a Bharata.”

	Vishvamitra did not miss the insinuation in his brother’s tone, but he decided to ignore it.  “Vishvamitra speaks both Dasa and Arya dialects with ease, and his most commonly described appearance could fit men from Tamralipti to Aspasoi, brother.  Far more leading is the fact that the Dasas proclaim him as one of their own.  They trust and follow him, often to their deaths.”

	“We do take his activities as indication of royal lineage, and his knowledge of our tactics as hint of Bharata descent,” Putakritu said softly.

	 Vishvamitra looked from brother to brother.  Putakritu was politely underlining the accusation in King Vishvaratha’s words.  “I do not mean to sound defensive, brothers, for your tone makes it clear that you think I am the traitor,” Vishvamitra said.  “But I can easily see flaws in this collation you have on Maharshi Vishvamitra.  Royal lineage is not requisite for a shrewd military mind.  Some of the best war commanders do not come from royal dynasties.  And any veteran in Yadava or Dasa armies would be familiar with our tactics.”

	“These are arguments we have heard before,” King Vishvaratha said dismissively.  “But the conclusion of our council is unanimous.  Vishvamitra is a Bharata, and most likely a royal one.”

	“And what is the council’s decision on this war?”  Vishvamitra asked.  “On the innocent Dasas, Druhyus and Purus who have lost their lives to Bharata aggression?”

	“It is innocent Bharatas that the council concerns itself with, Kaushika,” Putakritu reminded him.  “Hundreds died in Vinasana, Trigarta and Yamaprastha before our soldiers marched to battle.  You have been away for too long.  You have not been here to see the danger looming around our cities.”

	“No I have not, brother, but I have been in enemy lands,” Vishvamitra said, his tone and temper rising.  “I have seen Bharata soldiers violating every code of battle, striking at the innocent and unarmed.  I have seen women, children and the elderly slain without mercy.  I have seen cities ransacked even when their armies surrendered.  Is this the way we Bharatas carry out war?”

	Vishvaratha stood up, his nostrils flaring and his fists clenched.  “How dare you raise your voice to our eldest?”  The King demanded.  “Your years of exile have made you forget how to be a Bharata, an Arya even!”

	“Arya!”  Vishvamitra repeated with equal force.  “And what right do we claim to that title?  An Arya is not made by birth or physical aspect.  An Arya is made by thought and deed.  Noble and venerable- these are the traits of an Arya.  But these are not traits that can be ascribed to our actions in battle.”

	Putakritu stepped between the two brothers once again, looking weary and aged.  “The actions have been perpetrated by Divodasa,” he conceded, “not Vishvaratha.”

	“And we have done nothing to stop him,” Vishvamitra said, pushing his advantage.

	“I do not control the decisions of King Divodasa,” Vishvaratha said, “Just like he holds no control over mine.”

	Vishvamitra chuckled with sarcasm.  “So the Grand Bharata Kingdom is no more then- only Bharata Kingdoms with ancestral ties and little agreement.”

	“Control your insolence, Kaushika,” the King warned his brother.  “Hard decisions must always be made in battle.  Divodasa is making the final push on Bharatvarsha’s behalf, the lands and resources he wins will bring prosperity to our future generations.”

	“Debt and sin are passed to on to our descendants,” Putakritu added.  “The very idea of an innocent Dasa, Druhyu or Puru is a contradiction.  They carry the sins of their forefathers, and they must bear the vengeance as well.”

	Vishvamitra looked from brother to brother, seeing in their eyes a decisive support for Divodasa- and for the Bharata war at large.  “Vishvaratha,” he said aloud finally, coming to a decision of his own.  “There are several meanings to your name, brother.  But I know that you prefer the meaning that father intended- he who yokes the chariot that is this entire universe.  Some would speculate that it makes you the universe’s enemy, a mortal foe that must be defeated in order to survive.  Is it not uncanny that the title of your prime rival is Vishvamitra, he who is friend to this entire universe?  But then, you and I have never been much alike, have we?”

	Then he turned his back to his brothers and marched out of the hall before they could fully comprehend his revelation.  As a child, Vishvamitra loved to run in the bylanes of Kaushambhi, sneaking through narrow alleys and dodging carts while he played hide and seek with his friends.  The city’s underbelly had not changed much in his years of exile, and he was able to use some of those bylanes to make his escape before King Vishvaratha could assemble a force to capture him.  In his heart, Maharshi Vishvamitra knew that he would never visit his homeland again, and thus Kaushika was forever dead.  Only Vishvamitra remained now- and he had a duty to perform.
