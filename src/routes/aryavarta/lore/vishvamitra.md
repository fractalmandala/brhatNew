Every death, every victory and every battle will be for the right to answer these questions for all progeny of this land.<br><cite>Maharshi Vishvamitra to Bheda Puru</cite>

Fire, ash and soot danced in the air around them, the flames gushing furiously to their steady chant.  Their eyes were red, their noses inflamed.  But their booming prayer never faltered, their voices holding unshaken.  Kaushika’s deep, practiced voice was loudest- and the others knew instinctively that his was the timbre and meter to guide them.  

	“You, Agni, who powers above the strong, have made me the Soma’s priest to worship in assembly,” Kaushika chanted, and the others chanted with him.  “You shine to the Gods, I set the pressing stones.  I toil, I be joyful in you, Agni.”

	Their ritual continued for several hours, men and women taking turns to feed the flames with more ghee, Soma and wood.  Kaushika intoned verses of his own discovery, taking turns to address prayers to Agni, Indra, Soma, Surya and Mitra in descending order of frequency.  Several things about the ritual were distinctly unconventional.  This was no gathering of rshis or their pupils, nor would any of the prayers be recognizable to a rshi outside of Mulyasthana.  For this occasion, Kaushika had reserved only his original verses.  He observed the mass of several thousand people gathered around the gigantic, meticulously constructed platform of logs.  As the sun rose higher in the sky and the great prayer of Mulyasthana continued, the blazing fumes of their endeavor were visible even to the inhabitants of Ambastha further south.  

	When their ritual tone was well settled, when Kaushika knew from his inner faculty that the citizens of Mulyasthana truly chanted as one, unbroken voice vibrating in the air, he finally moved from chanting of the Devas to chanting of his gathering’s pain.  “Yama first found for us a place to dwell after This,” Kaushika chanted with perfect meter and pronunciation.  The others followed after him, for even in their Soma-induced frenzy they could not match him syllable to syllable on this strange, esoteric set of verses.  “Men born on earth tread their own paths, but ever they lead them where our ancient Fathers have departed.  Go forth, go forth upon the ancient pathways where our Pitras have gone before us.  Meet Yama, meet the Fathers, meet the merit of free or ordered acts in the highest heaven.  Go hence, depart, fly in all directions.  The Fathers have provided a place for them, and Yama adorns it with beams of light and water.”

	Hymns to Death- that was what Kaushika made Mulyasthana chant.  To ease the passing of souls that met sudden, futile deaths they were not warned of.  The northern city of Harayupa had been sacked by Bharata forces under the command of King Divodasa of Vinasana.  Thousands met their deaths under the wave of that unanticipated, unwarranted aggression on non-warring civilians.  Thousands more fled south to Mulyasthana, and even further to Vitabhya.  In time they would have to flee west, for these cities could not accommodate the sheer diaspora of Dasas and Druhyus the Bharata attack had precipitated.  

	Kaushika felt cold, brutal rage towards Divodasa- his cousin through their ancestor Suhotra, elder son of First King Bharata.  Divodasa’s imperial ambitions had previously extended till Trigarta and Madhyamika, but Bharata soldiers had never raised their weapons to innocent civilians before.  The sack of Harayupa went against the codes of not only Bharata honour but even the older, warrior honour at large.  And it offended the very grain of Aryavarta- for Harayupa was a supremely ancient and glorious city.  But he channeled the fury within him, uttering dark and potent hymns.  “Go hence, oh Death, pursue your special pathways- not the ones the Devas travel.  But to you I humbly pray- touch not our offspring, injure not our heroes.”

	Meter by meter, note by note, the great prayer began to grasp Kanaka’s Soma-sublimed consciousness.  He felt every pulsation Kaushika emitted, perceiving the layers of meaning embedded in each hymn.  He felt the pure despair for the death of innocent lives, and felt the angered state that asked to the why of it.  He quivered with hope when Kaushika chanted for courage in death, and when he expressed curiosity for the life that comes after.  He plunged into grief when the verses were to the anguish of death, of destruction and of losing ones’ homes and loved ones.  And as the hours passed and he continued on this spiritual journey, Kanaka realized that he sat in the company of no ordinary man.  This was not Kaushika, his friend from Bharatvarsha.  This was Maharshi Kaushika, a man of inexorably higher stature than him.  

	He said this to Kaushika later that night, when the grand ritual was over but its wispy after-effects were still running their course through the denizens of Mulyasthana.  But the man was as humble as ever, ascribing to himself only the title of a messenger.  “I have discovered these hymns, not composed them,” Kaushika corrected.  “But that is an old debate between us, my friend.”

	“No,” Kanaka protested.  “I cannot be your friend anymore.  I am not your equal, for you are obviously a man of superior vein.  And I am not alone in thinking this.  All of Mulyasthana, including those who have fled here from Harayupa, are referring to you by only one name- Maharshi.”

	“Maharshi Kaushika,” Kaushika said, sounding out the full title.  “It sounds distinctly unqualified.  There is none of the import that comes with a Vasishtha, Kashyapa or Atri.”  There was a playful smile upon his face- the spiritually ascended man vainly trying to hold on to the vestiges of his ordinary life.

	“That can be easily remedied,” Kanaka said, no longer seeing anything but a Maharshi in him.  “I see the way you treat people, the way you hold love for everything alive.  You are like no man I have ever met, and I have met many a kind in my time.  You cannot be of any tribe, of any one place; you are a friend to this entire world- a Vishvamitra.  And that is the name people will remember you by, I will make sure of it- Maharshi Vishvamitra.”

“Quick!”  Maharshi Vishvamitra shouted.  “This way!”  He ushered the farmers towards the escape route that was marked out by his men.  A burly Bharata soldier lunged at him and Vishvamitra evaded, stealthily slashing the stub-knife with his left hand.  It cut an ugly gash through the man’s torso, but it was not enough to bring him down.  He backed away and assessed Vishvamitra anew, a furious grimace upon his face.  Bharata soldiers continued to sack Mulyasthana indiscriminately, chasing away citizens and slaying any that tried to block them.  They ransacked the city like petty looters- more Rakshasas and Yakshas than any Arya tribe.  Vishvamitra returned the man’s gaze, his eyes blazing with a fury to match the soldier’s.  The warrior charged, and Vishvamitra primed his sword with his left hand.  Then, the wall of the hut next to them exploded and a rampaging elephant smashed through, thundering right through the charging Bharata soldier and throwing him several paces away.  Vishvamitra backed away in alarm, suddenly fuming at himself- the elephant could have easily broken through where he was standing.  He took a moment to look around himself and take stock of the situation.  

	Bharata soldiers from King Divodasa’s army had marched into Mulyasthana at dawn, choosing to attack even before the city’s rshis could complete their morning prayers- another flagrant defiance of convention.  The military stationing at Mulyasthana was sparse, especially since the Dasa-Druhyu strength was concentrated around Vitabhya in the light of recent attacks.  The few soldiers posted in the city met quick, futile deaths as they vainly lived up to their duties.  The Bharatas had circled north around Mulyasthana and attacked it simultaneously from two sides- east and north-west.  Vishvamitra spent the early hours of daybreak getting as many citizens out of Mulyasthana as possible.  Yet by noon the damage was peaking, and there were bodies lying everywhere- street after street ridden with the blood of its own inhabitants.  Emboldened by the lack of resistance, the Bharata soldiers had worked themselves into a bloodthirsty, plundering frenzy.   That was when Vishvamitra decided that Mulyasthana did not need him, it needed Prince Kaushika.  He rallied the sparse defense around him, using their better knowledge of the city to inflict tactical, heavy damage on the enemy.  But even that was only to buy the citizens more time, for Mulyasthana was lost the moment King Divodasa marched five thousand soldiers into the city.  

	Vishvamitra found several more elephant lines charging around him, recognizing from their insignia that the city of Vitabhya had finally sent aid.  They troubled the Bharatas till close to nightfall, when the enemy managed to bring all the beasts down.  Grimly satisfied that he had whisked every surviving inhabitant out of the city, Vishvamitra joined the last troupe fleeing to Vitabhya.  But Vitabhya would only be a stopover, he decided in his mind.  The Dasa-Druhyu ruling power was centered in Gandhara- too far away to actually feel this brunt of Bharata hostilities.  But something had to be done.  Fueled by a rage that now simmered constantly within him, Vishvamitra knew that he would go to Janmejaya and the Kurus.  Perhaps that lost Bharata line could save the tribe from the disgrace Divodasa was plunging it into.

 Vishvamitra examined the object King Janmejaya handed to him.  It was cubical, made of polished wood.  Each side had a number of dots carved into it, and within moments Vishvamitra noticed that the dots numbered from one to six- each number to a side.  “Interesting,” he observed.  “But what is it?”

	“It is the universe, my friend,” Janmejaya replied.  “Forgive me, I mean Maharshi Vishvamitra.”

	“You need not call me that, King Janmejaya,” Vishvamitra repeated.  “Kaushika will suffice, as it did before.”

	“You are too kind,” Janmejaya said somberly.  “But your reputation has preceded you, Maharshi.  We have heard of the grand ritual at Mulyasthana, of the great prayers to Yama and Death composed by you- and of the Gayatri Mantra.  We have even heard of your valiant defense of the city- though that part did not surprise me.”

	Vishvamitra’s eyes twinkled curiously, and suddenly Janmejaya felt as if his mind was being pierced by a higher awareness.  Then the Maharshi returned his attention to the object.  “The universe, you say.  How so, King Janmejaya?”

	King Janmejaya leaned back in his throne and looked to the ageing rshi next to him, saying, “Rshi Shukra Bhrigu can explain that better than me, Maharshi.  And there is no greater privilege for me than seeing your great minds interact.”

	That was when Vishvamitra turned his attention to Rshi Shukra.  “Bhrigu,” he repeated.  “There are not too many subscribers to that ancient school.”

	“Yet there are some, Maharshi,” Shukra said sagely, bowing and folding his hands in a namaskara.  

	There was a wise, perceptive gaze in Shukra’s eyes, and Vishvamitra realized that he was being tested.  King Janmejaya was a declared friend to Kaushika the Bharata prince, but he had not given his loyalties to Vishvamitra the Maharshi yet.  And Rshi Shukra would decide which way the King went.  

	“Do share your wisdom, Rshi Shukra,” Vishvamitra said.  “How is it that this simple object is the entire universe?”

	“What is the universe, Maharshi?  It is but chance, probability and fortune.  Our own version of the universe is this particular set of chance, probability and fortune.  Only one specific set of all probable values has created us and our world with all its Laws and Devas.  Thus, in this roll of the die a particular roll is the best- the optimum roll.”

	Vishvamitra followed every word of it, having encountered nihilistic philosophy such as this before.  The object in his hand was a die, and in any roll it would throw up a number from one to six.  Depending on what number he assigned as ‘desirable’, a single cast would be either optimum or not.  The entire universe was reduced only to the results of a die throw- a matter more of chance than of any conscious will.  The die made for a clear allegory, and Vishvamitra found himself admiring this novel way of representing such a detached, probabilistic view of life.  

	“I see a possible point of disagreement, Rshi Shukra,” Vishvamitra said.  “The throwing of the die itself is Law, it does not set laws through its result.  The die is thrown- this is evidence of conscious will.  This conscious will establishes that the Law is the random determination of a die.  Everything else is just the consequence.”

	“Consequence,” Rshi Shukra said.  “-the Law of Cause and Effect.  Every die throw precipitates another after it, for every cause has an effect.  Therefore, even that die must be the consequence of a previous throw.  This is an unbroken, unending chain of cause and effect that circles back into itself- just as in the infinite throw of die every number will occur an equal number of times, and everything is null.  There is no conscious will- a single quivering string can set a chain in motion.”

	Rshi Shukra’s words were deeply compelling, Vishvamitra found no hesitation in admitting that to himself.  The sage had obviously spent years in meditation of his philosophy, penetrating through to layers that were not perceivable from the path Vishvamitra’s own excavations had taken.  Yet he could spot the inherent, irreconcilable conflict in their philosophies.  “An unending chain of action and reaction still exists as itself- an entity we can speculate and meditate on.   Its existence is evidence of a cause prior to it.  What causes this chain to exist?  What causes the single string to quiver, the die to be thrown once, or an infinite number of times?”

	Rshi Shukra smiled, and the barely visible glaze of intellectual hostility suddenly disappeared from his eyes.  “Six,” the sage said.  “That is the number of questions it took you to reduce this die to its most fundamental query, great Maharshi.  “I cannot deny a mild envy when I tell you that it took me more than thrice as many to do so.”

	Maharshi Vishvamitra returned the smile, and he did correct the sage.  “I actually took three questions, Rshi Shukra.  The latter three were meant only to illustrate that I have solved your riddle.”

***

King Janmejaya heard his tale with patience and sympathy, but at the end he shook his head sadly.  “I cannot help you, Maharshi,” he said.

	Vishvamitra could not hide his surprise.  He had expected a more favourable reaction from Janmejaya.  “Hundreds of innocents have died, and hundreds more will die if Divodasa’s imperialism is allowed to grow unchecked.”

	“I agree,” said Janmejaya.  “But unfortunately, the Kuru cannot be the ones to discipline your cousin.”

	“He is your cousin too, King Janmejaya,” Kaushika replied.

	“Or uncle, or nephew,” Janmejaya corrected, while nodding in agreement nevertheless.  “But only you and I know that, dear Kaushika.  The Grand Bharata Kingdom knows nothing of who were are.  How will it read our intent if we announce ourselves by going to war against King Divodasa, in defence of Dasas and Druhyus?”

	“How will you know, if you do not do it and send message to Kings Pijavana, Vishvaratha and Satyadhriti?”

	Again Janmejaya shook his head in the negative.  “It is too great a risk, and my tribe has not confined itself to this forest for generations so that I may gamble away its ancestral claims.”

	“Ancestral claims?”  Vishvamitra repeated, trying a different approach now.  “The line of Samvarna is considered dead and cremated, King Janmejaya.  The Tritsu Bharatas now rule over what could have been yours, if your ancestry is true.  And how can you be sure your claim will be accepted, whenever you choose to reveal it?”

	A strange look came upon Janmejaya’s face, and suddenly Maharshi Vishvamitra perceived what he was about to say, before he said it.  “You will side with King Divodasa, will you not?”  He asked.

	Janmejaya nodded, managing to look somewhat abashed.  “The Bharatas are finally coming to war with the other Arya tribes, dear Kaushika.  And as the tribe of Samvarna, there is only one place we can occupy- by the Bharatas’ side.  I do not agree with Divodasa’s methods, I am as offended by the nature of his aggressions as you are.  But my personal morals cannot come in the way of my tribal duties.  To reveal ourselves when the Bharatas need us the most- that has been the plan of all my ancestors.  It was the prime directive delivered to me by my father, and I will pass it on to my son before I die- if I do not achieve it myself.”

	“I am a Bharata too,” Vishvamitra reminded his friend.  “After my exile is over, I have equal claim to the throne as my brothers, for that is my family’s way.  But that cannot prevent me from pointing out the error of our ways, or fighting against them if need be.  King Divodasa’s aggressions violate the Bharata way of life.  Never before have we killed innocent citizens, burnt homes and robbed away cattle.  That is not how Bharatas conduct war.”

	King Janmejaya gave Vishvamitra another sad look, and sighed deeply.  “I do not wish to argue this with you,” he said.  “I cannot claim that what you say is wrong, but I cannot do what you ask either.  I am sorry, Kaushika.  While completely aware that I refuse a Maharshi, I am forced to turn you away.  The Kurus will not take up arms against the Bharatas- not now, and not ever.”

	Vishvamitra knew that he had lost.  King Janmejaya and the Kurus would not come to his aid- that was certain.  “Very well, King Janmejaya of the Kurus,” he said before departing.  “I had truly not anticipated leaving your doors empty handed, for I did not think you to be immune to the plight of innocent Dasas and Druhyus.”

	“I am not immune to it, Maharshi, but I am bound by the laws of my tribe.  I will not have you leave my doors without a gift, however.  You may be a great Maharshi now, trying to broker peace and bring comfort to people who are not your own.  But you are also my friend, a wandering prince in exile who I learnt much from.  Ask me anything else, and it will be done.”

	“Keep my identity secret,” Kaushika said.  “Let none know that the exiled prince and the Maharshi are the same- especially those from our common tribe.”
