> As a child, you see your father going to war, and in adulthood the father stays back in aged, weary concern.  I do not begrudge losing out on one side of that experience.  Maybe one day, women will fight war just as men.  But my daughter will not be the first in that list.<br><cite>King Sudasa to his daughter</cite>

Prayaga was host to a Bharata war council, and King Vishvaratha was the chief attendant.  Ruler of Kaushambhi and Kanyakubja, his forces protected Prayaga’s western borders while King Pijavana was away on the campaign to regain Yamaprastha.  Vishvaratha was tall and gaunt, with a sharp face and piercing eyes.  He bore himself with a regal arrogance that the other Bharata Kings did not possess- inherited via his father Gathin from the venerable Kushambha- founder of Kaushambhi.  King Vishvaratha’s territories were sustained by a massive lumber industry at Kaushambhi, and river-crossing taxes collected at Kanyakubja.

	He was accompanied by a large party of attendants, guards, rshis and his son- Devaratha.  Devaratha was ten, and quite fond of his cousin Sudasa.  He wasted no time in challenging Sudasa to a race around Prayaga’s royal palace.  Sudasa inevitably won, but Devaratha was sure that the margin was smaller this time.  Vishvaratha’s elder brother and their dear uncle Putakritu was waiting for them by the time they reached the end line and bent over panting.  

	“Sudasa is still quite ahead of you, Deva,” Putakritu said with a smile, teasing the youngest of his four nephews.  

	“One day,” Devaratha replied between deep breaths, sounding determined.  

	Putakritu patted his back and said to the boys, “Come on now, Vishvaratha wants both of you to be there for the council.”  Putakritu was the eldest of late King Gathin’s three sons.  A hunting injury had rendered him incapable of producing progeny, and so Putakritu declined his father’s throne- which went to Vishvaratha, the middle son.  Kaushika the youngest was exiled, and none spoke about him, in public at least. 

	The boys followed their uncle back to the council room.  The situation with the Yadavas was tense, and a Yadava attack on Kanyakubja or Kaushambhi could not be ruled out.  If Kaushambhi fell under enemy hands, then Prayaga would not be safe either.  King Vishvaratha had called the gathering upon arriving at Prayaga, calling King Pijavana’s advisors along with his own.  Also present was crown-prince Pratardana of Kashi- cousin to Sudasa and Devaratha.  

	King Vishvaratha spoke with perfect pronunciation, using the classical Sanskrit dialect nurtured at Kashi and Prayaga.  “An all-out war can break out at any time,” he said.  “We cannot rule out a co-ordinated attack from the Purus, Yadavas and Druhyus together.”

	“I agree,” said Putakritu.  “Our current deployments and patrols are stretched far too thin to cover for that eventuality.  Ahikshetra has become a remote town under this configuration, and I do not trust the Suryavanshi at Sravasti as much as others might.”  That was a reference to the official policy at Prayaga.  The Kingdom of Kanyakubja and Kaushambhi did not share Prayaga’s affinity to the Suryavansha.

	“What aid can Kashi provide?”  Asked Dhrita, close advisor to King Pijavana.  Dhrita was from a distant branch of Bharata blood, removed from the royal lines by several degrees.  

	“Kashi can protect the Gomati and block ingresses through the Naimisharanya, but even we would be stretched thin if our lines patrol all the way up to Ahikshetra,” replied Pratardana.  Like his forefathers, he was a Rajarshi- both a King and a Seer.  His was the line of the first great Bharata rshis- Gritsamada, Shunaka and Dhanvantari.  He was more than a decade elder to Sudasa, and this was only the third time he was seeing his cousin from Kashi.  

	King Vishvaratha looked to Dhrita and said, “Pijavana sent me word that he intends to ask for help from Ayodhya.”  

	Dhrita nodded.  “The Suryavansha-Yadava rivalry goes back way before First King Bharata.  The Solar dynasty has not forgotten the sack of Vitabhya centuries ago, nor that of Ayodhya more recently.  King Pijavana thought we could leverage this to our advantage.”

	Vishvaratha turned to one of his own advisors.  “Have we received news from Vinasana?”

	“King Divodasa continues to be troubled around his own borders,” the advisor replied.  “But he can spare five hundred men to press upon Mathura, if need be.  He cannot afford to send them across the Yamuna though- he will need their swift return if Vinasana is attacked.”

	“Five hundred men is generous, given the pressures on Divodasa’s borders,” said Putakritu.  “But right now we need soldiers to protect our territories, not to attack the Yadavas’”

	“I disagree, brother,” said King Vishvaratha.  “Look at us- we are the representatives of the Grand Bharata Kingdom, but we talk as if we are chieftains of tribes with petty, scattered bands of men.  Is that what our enemies see us as?  I think it is time to take the offensive to the Yadavas.  Let us welcome Divodasa’s five hundred at the borders of Mathura.  We have enough men to leave behind, to protect Prayaga and Kaushambhi.  I would march the rest to Mathura, and Ekachakra after.  If we capture those two cities, we can cast the Yadavas away from the Yamuna.”

	Vishvaratha spoke in his stately voice, making it clear that the King had made his decision.  Putakritu nodded, and Pratardana said- “Kashi too will send five hundred men for this march.”

	“Let us begin immediately,” said Vishvaratha, as he turned to his commander.  “Gather fifteen hundred men on the plains west of Prayaga, and send word to Divodasa.  With Pijavana and his forces, we can descend on Mathura with a combined strength of two thousand five hundred warriors.”

	The commander was off to carry out his orders and King Vishvaratha departed as well, nodding briefly in the direction of Sudasa and Devaratha.  Putakritu followed his brother, and the other attendants filed out, leaving the cousins alone in the hall.  “We are going to war, aren’t we?”  Devaratha asked, looking as much of a young boy as Sudasa felt.  “It won’t just stop at Mathura.  The Yadavas will retaliate, and then we will strike again, and it will never stop.” 

	“It will stop when we win,” Sudasa said softly.  “And maybe you and I will complete that journey together, cousin.”  In his young mind, he imagined himself and Devaratha atop majestic, black stallions- friends in life and war much like Ikshvaku and Haryashva.

***

**Year 33, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

Ikshvaku was young, but he was no boy.  This realization came upon Haryashva gradually over the four months he spent with the Suryavansha.  There were very little rules around a Kingship, no legal precedents to define Ikshvaku’s powers.  He was the First King, an unprecedented event among the tribes of land, horse and river.  He inspired loyalty in the men around him, carrying himself with maturity and authority.  Haryashva knew that part of that loyalty was to the Solar pendant around Ikshvaku’s neck, but most of Ikshvaku’s power was gathered by the grit of his leadership.  

News came from the north that Vaivasvat Manu was blessed with three more sons- Pramshu, Sharyati and Nabhaga.  Haryashva suggested that Ikshvaku send assassins to kill these competitors.  But the very idea was absurd to the young King.  These were his brothers, he solemnly told Haryashva, bonded to him by blood.  It took Haryashva many weeks before he realized that this was not Ikshvaku’s naiveté, but his moral principle.

Two weeks after his arrival at Avisari, Haryashva joined Ikshvaku and some of his best soldiers for an incursion into the dreaded Kamyakvana, spread between the Vitasta and Iravati rivers.  Ikshvaku was determined that the forest had to be cleared of its malevolent Rakshasa tribes.  The King’s decision did not come out of xenophobia, Haryashva learnt.  Ikshvaku had spent weeks trying to negotiate with the Rakshasas, but they retaliated only with violence.  Their belligerence made it difficult to navigate along the rivers by boat, in turn making it impossible to take trade south, where the rivers met the mighty Sindhu.  

Kamyakvana was the largest forest Haryashva had ever seen, indeed ever thought possible.  The mountains of the north were scattered with firs, spruces and hemlocks, but no gathering of trees was ever as dense and suffocating as the Kamyakvana.  A few steps into the forest and one was engulfed in darkness, the trees’ branches intertwining with each other and creating an almost endless covering of leaves.  Even in the day, they entered with lamps and torch lights- the forest lived in a night of perpetual black.  Haryashva was warned that the Rakshasas were natives to the forest, used to living in the dark conditions after generations of inhabitation.  He was to expect an ambush anytime, from any quarter.  A chill went up his spine when they walked into the forest, and the brave Ashvaka mused at himself when he found comfort from the boy King beside him, who said, “Fear not, my Ashvaka friend.  Stay within my sword’s arc, and you will leave this forest unscathed.”

The boy-King lived up to his promise.  Haryashva certainly pulled his own weight, but Ikshvaku saved his life on four different occasions.  No matter what the King did or how many Rakshasas he took on at once, his one eye remained on Haryashva.  When an arrow came at Haryashva, Ikshvaku was by his side to slice it away with his sword.  When a Rakshasa came at him from behind, Ikshvaku jumped in between and sawed him in half.  Even as Haryashva fought, he couldn’t stop himself from glancing at the fighting, young King.  Ikshvaku slew dozens more than Haryashva, moving at speeds no Ashvaka could.  When the fires died out and the battle was over, the son of Manu was radiant even in the dark.  Blood appeared black on his armor, his eyes glinting of steel.  That was when Haryashva knew for sure that Ikshvaku would be the King to lead men against the Yakshas in the north, back in Kapisa.  

***

More than eight months and countless battles later, Ikshvaku finally promised Haryashva a meeting to discuss plans for the north.  Winter was to set in soon, and once the snow started falling, the passes to Kapisa and beyond would be closed.  The fields would be barren of both plant and animal life, hardly the conditions for an army to march.  The time to cleanse the northern mountains of the Yakshas was now.

Avisari was the declared capital of the King, official seat of the nascent Suryavansha Empire.  News of Ikshvaku the Solar, son of Manu, spread wide and the town’s population had grown considerably.  Settlements sprung up outside the walls as well, complete with markets and hutments.  At the centre of the town lay the Rajalaya- King’s quarters.  Larger than any man-made structure Haryashva had ever seen, it was an elaborate complex of halls, yards, gardens and private chambers.  Ikshvaku’s quarters were towards the west wing of the Rajalaya, looking out to its main garden.  

“Ah, Haryashva,” Ikshvaku said when Haryashva walked in, “Come, I’ve been making plans all night, and I want to discuss them with you.”

“There are some that say that the descendants of Surya need no sleep,” Haryashva jested as he sat down in front of the King.  The two had grown familiar in recent months, and Ikshvaku allowed Haryashva to forgo the protocols that the Suryavanshi followed.  Many muttered that he was too cavalier in front of the King.  But as long as Ikshvaku did not care, Haryashva did not either.

Ikshvaku chuckled.  “They say many things about the descendants of Surya.  But fight me without my armour, and you’ll find I’m not as invincible as they say either.”

“You’re invincible enough,” Haryashva replied, and he meant it.  No man was as powerful on the battlefield as Ikshvaku, even at his young age.

Ikshvaku nodded, uncomfortable under praise as always.  “It is time to help your people,” he said.  “After the recent campaigns in Kamyakvana, we’ve lost some good men.  But many more have joined us since.  Have you visited the barracks of late?”

“No,” Haryashva replied, “But I have heard as much from Senapati Drishta.”

“And our training programme has improved as well.  Maharshi Vasishtha has devised certain military formations that are tailored to the tactics we use.”

Haryashva nodded.  “Just the other day I saw a unit practicing something called the Sarpa Vyuha.”

“That, and many more formations,” Ikshvaku replied.  “And my army in Avisari is more than two thousand strong now, enough men that I can leave a sufficient number behind to guard our territories while we march north.”

“I’m happy to hear that, young King.  I fear that if we do not drive the Yakshas out this winter, we will lose the opportunity forever.  One more season and they will have built permanent settlements there, and we will lose those lands.”

Ikshvaku nodded.  “My thinking exactly.  In any case, scouts report that the Rakshasas that fled from Kamyakvana have made their way across the Sindhu.  There’s nowhere for them to go from there, but north or west.  A month or so, and they could join the Yakshas and make things further difficult for us.”

“So what do you plan to do?”

“Mobilize immediately.  I’ve already instructed Senapati Drishta, and he will prepare my forces the moment I give command.  We now need to chart our routes.  You say that there are at least six settlements.  Assuming that at least another two could have sprung up in the months since you joined us, I’m splitting the army into two contingents of five hundred each.  Senapati Drishta will lead one, and I will lead the other.  It is up to you to organize the Ashvakas, Haryashva.  I understand that yours is a proud, independent clan, but for this campaign they will have to submit to the Suryavansha banner.”

“You may keep in mind, young King, that I came to your town to submit to the King and ask for his help.  The Ashvakas welcome the son of Manu as their king.  We trace our descent from Kashyapa as well, and as such we are kinsmen.”

Ikshvaku smiled.  Not his young, boyish smile but his benevolent, Kingly smile.  “And how many Ashvaka kinsmen can I expect on this campaign?”

“All of them, more than one thousand strong.”

Ikshvaku’s eyes widened.  “One thousand?”  He repeated in surprise.  “Kapisa cannot be more than a few hundred strong, are you telling me that hundreds of Ashvakas roam the mountains?”

“I am,” Haryashva replied.  “And Kapisa is not a town in the way you consider it, Ikshvaku.  It has no permanent residents save a single family of priests.  To the Ashvakas, it is simply a place to stop by from time to time, gather news and trade goods.  We are of the older ways, nomadic in the true sense.”

“Well, that changes plans considerably.  I was expecting no more than a few hundred Ashvakas.  But with your thousand riders we can support three contingents, and cover a larger amount of territory.  This is heartening, Haryashva.  Your riders and my Suryavanshi warriors will be more than a match for the Yakshas.”

“That I never doubted, young King.”  There were a few moment of silence.  Then, Haryashva asked, “So when do we start?”

“Soon, I just have one duty to take care of.”  Ikshvaku hesitated, opened his mouth to speak, and then closed it.  Finally, he asked, “How are the women in Kapisa?”

Haryashva frowned.  Ikshvaku had never talked of women before.  “Fair and fierce,” he replied.  “Why do you ask?”

“Just wondering what I might be missing out on,” Ikshvaku replied.  “I am to get married, you see.  I am of age now, and a King does not leave his land and go to war, without an heir safely ensconced somewhere.  So before we march to the nort,h I have to find a wife and place my seed in her.”

Haryashva would have quipped, but the King had already reddened well enough.

***

“Drink,” Haryashva insisted, as he passed the bag of water to Ikshvaku.  “A parched throat allows more of the cold in.”  

Ikshvaku obliged, though Haryashva suspected that it was more out of politeness.  The young King seemed, for the most part, as impervious to the cold as he was to the heat and sun.  He did not even don his armour, claiming it would be unjust to pile that unnecessary weight on his horse over the harsh journey.  Clad in the simple tigerskin robe, he seemed more at home in the cold mountains than Haryashva the Ashvaka.  Even the stallion accepted Ikshvaku with grace and readiness, and Ashvaka horses were known to be wary of outsider blood.  He is not just the Suryavanshi King, Haryashva thought, he is my King- and the ashva knows this.  

“You told me once that the Ashvakas claim their descent from Kashyapa as well,” Ikshvaku said.  “How so?”

“I do not know the details, young King.  But the legend is that the Ashvakas have descended from one of the later sons of Maharshi Kashyapa.”

“When this campaign is over,” Ikshvaku said, “Remind me to assign a bard to Kapisa, we can bring the Ashvakas officially into our fold then.”

“And what do these bards do?”

“Think of them as record keepers.  They memorise genealogies, court proceedings, birth and coronation dates and the like.”

Haryashva snorted.  “You Suryavanshi place far too much importance on genealogies and progeny.  A man’s skill with the sword does not depend on that of his fathers.”

“True,” Ikshvaku agreed, “But if one’s father and coach are skilled warriors, then does not one stand a better chance?  We do not speak of the strength of the individual, Haryashva; we speak of the strength of the family, the dynasty.  And that comes from producing strong and capable lines.  Think of the way the Ashvakas breed horses.  Do you not look for the best stock, and separate the weak from it?”

“You are comparing men with horses.”

“Only because the purpose is the same- to produce a lineage that is supreme.”

Haryashva did not push the point further.  He knew well that Ikshvaku was uncomfortable by the divine right accorded to him, merely by his descent.  This discomfort drove the King to practice and battle as hard as any warrior; as if only in leading by example could he truly justify his right to rule.  

Two scouts returned from the front, and Ikshvaku signalled for the line to stop behind him.  Haryashva heard a few horses nigh in protest.  This was open valley ground among the mountains, carpeted by ample grass.  It was in the beasts’ instinct to gallop across the landscape.  The riders came up to Ikshvaku and stopped smartly, clearly familiar with their stallions.  

“There is a minor stream that diverts off the Sindhu, a yojana ahead,” one of the scouts reported.  “The foothills beyond the stream are scattered with Yakshas.  One of the hills hold their settlement, King Ikshvaku.”

Ikshvaku nodded, his jaws set firm and sharp.  “Well done,” he commended his scouts.  “Join your contingents and prepare for battle.”  He signalled to his guardsman and the rider set off along the line, delivering the King’s message that the battle was to begin.  

Haryashva felt a familiar wave of adrenaline rise up, the one that preceded every battle.  “Full formation ahead, or guerrilla?”  

“Both,” Ikshvaku replied.  “We can be sure that these mountain Yakshas are familiar with the art of guerrilla battle themselves, so we cannot use that as an element of surprise.  I will push the full formation ahead, let them think that we come at them with all our might.  They will either prepare to fight, or decide to flee.  If it’s the latter, we bring the guerrilla formations upon them.”

They heard the crunching sound of rock upon rock and turned left to see a boulder rushing down the mountain.  It took only a second for Haryashva to calculate that the boulder was well outside the path of their line.  Then his gaze went further up, and he saw dozens of black Yaksha figures descending rapidly in the boulder’s wake.

“Well,” Ikshvaku said grimly from beside him, as he put on his armour.  “Looks like they’ve brought the battle to us.”

***

The Yakshas were a ferocious enemy.  They were tall and brutish, their arms long, and their swings wild.  Most had axes, but many charged with simple clubs and spears.  A few among them held swords, but from the way they swung them, Ikshvaku knew that they were not familiar to them.  But he found himself admiring their amazing endurance.  Slice and hack at one as much as you’d like, but he wouldn’t back off till he bled to death.  The best way to end any fight was to simply cut the Yaksha in two, but even that, Ikshvaku was finding out, was not as easy as he had expected.  

These brutes were both strong and cunning, not like the dumb, hostile Rakshasas of Kamyakvana.  Their weapons came at him hard, the force grunting onto his bones behind his shield.  When they charged, they came with the power of stone and rock, enough to knock a man off his feet and fling him some distance away.  They snarled and snapped, cursed and spat, creating more chaos on the field than need be, and throwing many of his formations off their line.  Their surprise attack had denied Ikshvaku the use of his archers, most of whom fell under the Yaksha onslaught.  He knew that the Ashvakas would hold their own, but many of his warriors had been caught off guard and disoriented- the expected results of a guerrilla attack.  

Two Yakshas came at Ikshvaku together, and by now they had sensed that he was the leader.  They circled around him, all eager to get a chance to come at him.  The only reason they came in ones and twos was that anymore, and they would come within the arcs of each other’s weapons.  So they waited at the perimeter, coming at him in waves.  Undaunted, Ikshvaku whirled his sword all around, easily following the stances and thrusts his father taught him many years ago.  Since then he had modified the fighting style heavily, but the basic angles of swing, the pattern of breathing between attacks and defensive stances, and the design of the sword itself remained the same.  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Haryashva trying to rush towards him, hacking and cutting his way through the circle of Yakshas that gathered around Ikshvaku.  He ducked under a swinging club and sliced his sword straight through the legs of another Yaksha.  As he got up, he pressed his shield against the onslaught of a third Yaksha and knocked the second off his legs.  The Yaksha’s scream of agony drowned out the charging yell of a fourth Yaksha, who came at him from behind and knocked his helmet off his head.  Stunned and his ears ringing, he turned around just as the third Yaksha came crashing at him again.  He heard his shield break and felt the wrist behind it shatter as he flew in the air, and fell painfully some distance away.  Agony shot up in his spine and then exploded all over his body, before he gave in to the pain and lost consciousness.  

***

When he came to, the first thing that hit him was the cold, right down to his bone.  He was shivering by the time his eyes opened completely, and a blurry figure draped another layer of blanket-skins over him.  Then, while he considered whether he felt any less colder, the pain hit him and he remembered every injury he sustained.  His right wrist was broken, he knew that as much from the memory of the Yaksha crashing into him as from the pain of it.  His spine had sustained severe damage, and he could vividly picture the fall that caused it.  Around the edges of his left eye’s vision, he could see his swollen face, and his ears throbbed with a faint, ringing sound even now.  

“The moment I take my eyes off you,” he heard a voice say, “You get into trouble.”

He opened his mouth to speak, but it was too dry, and he only ended up coughing.  With each cough his abdomen tightened and hurt, and by now the pain had spread to his legs and feet.  He tried to lift his head, to find the source of the voice.  A figure moved into his vision and placed a soft hand under his head to guide it back down.  He slid his eyes upwards and the concerned, aged face of his father swam into view.

“Rest, my son,” Vaivasvat Manu said, running his hand across Ikshvaku’s forehead and through his hair.  Then he lifted his head gently, and brought a pot of water to his lips.  Ikshvaku sipped, feeling some relief as the warm, soothing water washed down his parched throat.

“Father,” Ikshvaku said hoarsely when he was done drinking.  “Where are we?”

“Not far from where you were injured,” Manu replied.  “In your condition, you could not be moved too much.”

“How long has it been?”

“A week.  You have shifted in and out of consciousness since then.  I arrived less than a day ago.”

There were many questions he wanted to ask, but the pain was making him foggy and irritated.  He asked the one that seemed most important.  “What of the battle?”

Manu smiled.  “Worry not, my son.  Your Suryavanshi were victorious, and the Ashvakas aided them valiantly.  You can learn all about that when you recover.”
