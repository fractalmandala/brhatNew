> Aryavarta has always been only a concept, a means of identity.  What are its borders?  Where does it start and where does it end?  What is common to all that inhabit it?  Not till we answers these questions can we say that we are Arya and they are not.<br><cite>Rshi Vasishtha to King Sudasa Bharata</cite>

Once the mighty Sarasvati would have flowed through these lands, and through the stories of Rshi Vasishtha, Sudasa could imagine the great river in its glory- a massive sustainer of culture and civilization, peace and prosperity.  Great cities like Plaksha, Vinasana, Trigarta, Madra and Sivobheda flourished along its banks.  The Maharshis Atri, Kashyapa and Vasishtha meditated to the sound of its currents, as did Yati, Angirasa, Kanva and Medhatithi generations after them.  It was not for nothing that the songs of the Sarasvati were the songs of the Veda.  

	But cracked earth and parched bushes had now taken over, and the river was already a figure of history and legend.  Sudasa’s contingent of five hundred men took half the time to ride from Vinasana to Mulyasthana than it would have taken in the Sarasvati’s days.  This was the territory of King Divodasa- quite recently acquired.  The sack of Mulyasthana was six years old, but the city still wore a broken, defeated look.  Not many of its previous structures were rebuilt, and their debris was strewn all along the city’s inner lanes and alleys.  King Divodasa’s hasty rebuilding efforts concentrated on the barracks and defensive outposts, and the only population at Mulyasthana was Bharata soldiers living in a state of war.  Crown Prince Sudasa was here at his uncle’s request, and he arrived at Mulyasthana to hear the soldiers whispering of a mysterious leader among the Dasa-Druhyu confederation- Vishvamitra.     

	“The Dasas call him a Maharshi,” said Ketavya- commander of Divodasa’s military contingent at Mulyasthana.  “A warrior-Maharshi at that.  He seems to be as adept at the sword as he is at fire and ritual.”

	“And does he command any real power?”  Sudasa asked.  

	Ketavya scoffed.  “This is a ploy, Crown Prince,” he said.  “The Dasas seek to spread legend and rumours through our ranks.  They may as well say that they have the soul of Narantaka reincarnated, leading them from Gandhara!  But that should not distract us from our current concerns.”

	“Which are?”

	“Consolidation and expansion,” Ketavya replied immediately.  “Our triumphs at Harayupa and Mulyasthana are incomplete if we do not conquer the entire Iravati and Shatadru.  And for this, we must make a move on Vitabhya.”  

	“And what is the intention behind this conquest, Commander Ketavya?”  Sudasa asked.  “Why is King Divodasa leaving his territories exposed to the Purus?”  

	Ketavya lowered his head.  “I am the leader of an infantry division at the forefront of the Bharata army, Crown Prince Sudasa.  I cannot claim to know the strategies of my King.”

	“But when my uncle asked for my help, he did not mention a conquering ride to Vitabhya.  His intent was clearly for us to find a solution to these Druhyu raids.  They are too frequent and well organized for their source to be Gandhara.  The power sending them has to be closer to us- perhaps a town like Zarattala.”

	Ketavya raised his eyebrows in puzzlement.  “I have not heard that name before.”

	“It is not really a town of note,” Sudasa conceded.  “But it is still close enough for the raiding parties to assemble and organize there.  And we are certain it is not Vitabhya that is sending the aggressors?”

	Ketavya nodded confidently.  “Vitabhya does not have the numbers to send so many, so frequently.  Which is why it is important we conquer the city and establish ourselves.  We can withstand raids from the west much more effectively there.”

	That is what King Prithu once thought as well, Sudasa thought to himself.  Aloud he said, “I cannot support a raid on Vitabhya without the explicit instructions of King Divodasa, Commander.  I suggest we search for this figure you mentioned- Vishvamitra.  If we do not find the man, we will at least find the source of the rumours, and perhaps the raids.”

***

Ambhastha- one of the few surviving towns of old Aryavarta.  The population was clearly Dasa- with their distinct ritualistic and dialectic quirks.  But Sudasa knew that once, the people of Ambhastha were Suryavanshi- proud, austere and progressive.  Prithu was the last Suryavanshi King to have ruled over the town, and even the later revival by Trsadasa and his successors did not extend south of the Kamyakvana.  Here, Sudasa learnt of the grand ritual at Mulyasthana, conducted by the Maharshi Vishvamitra.  People spoke of the man with deep reverence, and Sudasa was surprised to find that his origins were traced back to Bharatvarsha- to the city of Kanyakubja.  

	“He cannot be a Bharata,” Mitrayu declared with confidence.  At the age of sixteen, he was fast becoming his father’s trusted lieutenant.  And though he did not have the benefit of Aikshvaku military training, his lean figure and taut muscles spoke of a formidable warrior capability.  “No Bharata would align himself with the lot of Dasa or Druhyu.”

	Some might, Sudasa thought.  He did feel a certain sympathy for the displaced populations of Harayupa and Mulyasthana.  There was no justification for King Divodasa’s aggressions- the Dasas and Druhyus had been content to stay west of the Shatadru.  And he saw enough of the debris at Mulyasthana to know that the damage did not come without severe human casualties.  “What do you make of these reports about a secret contingent hidden in Khandakvana?”  Sudasa asked.  He enjoyed running his thoughts through Mitrayu’s straightforward, unfettered thinking.  

	“Old news,” Mitrayu said.  “The Purus have always been building their numbers in the shadows of Khandakvana.  We receive broken reports about a secret Puru Kingdom within the forest.”

	This was new to Sudasa, and he felt certain that even his father was not aware of it.  The Puru King Bhuvamanyu was cunning and tactical.  He made no explicit signs of aggression towards the Bharatas, but his support to Yadava armies more than made up for that.  Now, if he was building numbers within Khandakvana, then it was only a matter of time before he marched south- and it was no secret that the great Puru desire was to retain their dynastic capital- Pratisthana.  “Why have we not investigated this further?”  Sudasa asked.

	“The Khandakvana is still as large and dangerous as ever, cousin,” Mitrayu replied.  “Swamps, predators and Rakshasas make it sheer foolishness to send a force in.  We have more pressing concerns than such rumours.  If King Bhuvamanyu Puru makes a move, we will know.  And then we will press the combined forces of our fathers against him.”

	With the Dasas and Druhyus on our backs for our current aggressions, Sudasa thought.  It was a fearsome thought- the idea of Purus, Yadavas, Dasas and Druhyus aligning against the Bharatas once and for all.  But then the words of Rshi Vasishtha came to him- A great battle is coming, young Sudasa.  But likely that your father will not lead the Bharatas to war and victory, you will.”  

	“I agree with you,” said Mitrayu, breaking into Sudasa’s thoughts.  “We must investigate the town of Zarattala, on the Lorikdanai river.  If this Vishvamitra is not found there, we can finally turn our attention to Vitabhya in full force.”

There was a strange similarity between them- in the brown of their eyes and the sharp cut of their noses.  They assessed each other with a similar look- that of a royal Bharata- and Sudasa realized intuitively that he faced a member of his own dynasty.  

	“Crown Prince Sudasa,” the man said, “I have been eager to meet you.”

	Sudasa was not surprised to be recognized.  News of him could have easily carried to Zarattala from Ambhastha, especially if there were prying ears.  He was more curious about the fleeting resemblance between the man and those of his own line.  “And who are you, citizen of Zarattala?”

	The man gave an easy, infectious laugh.  “I am not citizen of Zarattala, dear Sudasa.  I am only a visitor, forced to flee here because my previous habitat was invaded by Bharata forces.  I am Kaushika, and you may remember me as the third son of late King Gathin.”

	Sudasa’s eyes widened in surprise.  “Uncle Kaushika!”  He exclaimed.  He had never met the uncle before, of course.  But there was no young Bharata who did not know the tale of Prince Kaushika’s exile and hoped for his eventual return.  

	“Uncle indeed,” Kaushika said.  “When I heard that the son of Pijavana lead’s the Bharata forces to Zarattala, I knew that I had to see you.”

	Sudasa did a quick calculation in his head.  “Twenty years are now done,” he said.  “How long we must wait before you return home?”

	Kaushika smiled, impressed that his nephew cared enough to remember the years of exile.  But then he said, “I’m afraid it may be longer still, dear Sudasa.  The west needs me, it needs every helping hand it can find.  More than twenty thousand people have been displaced by Divodasa’s attacks.  Disease, starvation, strife and homelessness- this is now their lot.  I cannot abandon my hosts in their time of need.”

	Sudasa appeared to look guilty.  “I do not understand the reason behind Uncle Divodasa’s campaign,” he explained.

	“I do not expect you too, dear nephew.  You are but twenty-five years old- too young to know the ramblings of aged minds.”

	That is when a sliver of suspicion entered Sudasa’s mind.  “I am here looking for someone, Uncle.  Perhaps you can help me.”  The rumours did say that Maharshi Vishvamitra was a Bharata.  Was it possible that Kaushika was the same man?

	Kaushika spread his arms wide, his eyes twinkling radiantly as they subjected Sudasa to intense scrutiny.  “The Iravati and Shatadru are rife with the name of Maharshi Vishvamitra,” Sudasa continued, ignoring Kaushika’s unsettling gaze.  “They say he is both a warrior and a Maharshi, and he leads the Dasa raids troubling Uncle Divodasa.  I am here looking for this man.”

	Kaushika gave his nephew a look of genuine innocence.  “I have not heard this name here, Sudasa.  And a Maharshi, you say?  This sounds more like a propaganda product from Vitabhya.”

	“That is what some of my advisors feel as well, but I do not share that skepticism.  The Dasa raids are too frequent and well organized for their origin to be Gandhara.  I had suspected that Zarattala was the source, but I see now how desolate it is and know that I was wrong.  This does not mean that there cannot be other, hidden villages along the Lorikdanai.  Perhaps you have word of them?”

	There was a resolute air around Sudasa, Kaushika sensed it the moment he laid eyes on his young nephew.  He was not one to be distracted or strayed.  “There are a few villages upstream,” Kaushika conceded.  “But you will find neither soldiers nor Maharshis there.”  Every word of that was true.  But he knew that Sudasa would not take his word for it.  

	The young Bharata hid his suspicions well.  “Then I must not waste my time here, Uncle,” he said.  “Come back with us.  Uncle Putakritu talks of you often, and he has sent searching parties all over Aryavarta looking for you.  I cannot return to him having met you and not brought you back.”

	Kaushika placed a reassuring hand on his nephew’s shoulder.  “I remember the way back home, Sudasa.  And I will return when the time is right.  For now, while our dear relative Divodasa’s belligerence continues, I cannot be anywhere but here- with the Dasas.”

	“Uncle Divodasa will turn to Vitabhya now,” Sudasa said, almost apologetically.  “He feels he can better defend his borders from there.”

	“The Suryavanshi King Prithu too must have felt that,” said Kaushika, mirroring Sudasa’s earlier thoughts.  “But Vitabhya has always been a city notoriously tough to defend.  Divodasa may take it easily, but he will not be able to keep it.”

***

With an army of more than five thousand soldiers amassed outside the borders of Vitabhya, King Divodasa did not need the aid of Sudasa and his five hundred men.  The conquest of Vitabhya would be swift and decisive, even Sudasa was certain of that.  The city held no more than two thousand fighting defendants, and large sections of its population had migrated away to the west in recent months.  As Mitrayu led his army through the gates of Vitabhya, Sudasa rode for Khandakvana, determined to know the truth behind rumours of a Puru army hidden in its midst.  News of Vitabhya’s defeat reached him even as he camped his soldiers outside Khandakvana’s western borders. 

	Sudasa waited for the sun to be well in the sky the next day before leading his men into the forest.  At its fringes, the forest was sparse- generations of inhabitants along the Sarasvati had procured their woods from its trees.  But as they waded in, the sunlight grew sparse and its lines thin through the leaves, before they disappeared completely.  Tall, expansive trees surrounded them from all sides and a faint, hazy light engulfed the forest.  Sudasa led his men cautiously, wary of either man or beast falling upon them without warning.  As the day wore on even the faint pall of sunlight disappeared, and the men had to light torches to see their way.  The night passed without incident, predators opting to stay away from the large mass of men with weapons of fire in their hands.  But Sudasa could not shake off the distinct feeling of being watched by human eyes.   Close to dawn, he sensed a shift in the forest.  Animals had not come upon them for a while, and there was a faint, distant rustling that suggested the deliberate movement of a large mass.  The feeling of being observed was gone now, replaced by a dark sense of foreboding.  

	Sudasa instructed his men to bunch up into defensive formations and lie in wait.  The forest was unfamiliar to them, and whatever force approached was clearly at home here.  There was no guessing what traps might lie in wait for his men, though he could not figure out why there had been no surprise ambush yet.  Sunlight was attempting to peep in through the trees by the time the approaching mass was clearly within sound.  Sudasa and his men were hungry and under-slept.  The Bharata Crown Prince went from trench to trench, and whispered words of encouragement to his men- many of whom were far older to him and veterans of war.  His thoughts went to Suhotra- elder son of First King Bharata.  That great prince had ensured that he met no small, pithy death.  He led great battles, but lived to see the end of his days.  That was the fate Sudasa intended for himself as well.

“You could have spared the both of us a great deal of trouble, Crown Prince,” said King Janmejaya.  “As you can quite clearly see, not a single man in your force was harmed.  We intended for a peaceful discussion, not bloody conflict.”

	King Janmejaya’s words had merit.  The Kuru warriors did sustain injuries of their own, but they ensured that they captured every man in Sudasa’s force unharmed.  Once Sudasa’s call for attack had run through his formations, the Kurus’ cries for ceasefire were drowned out by roaring war chants.  They were left with no option but to disarm and capture Sudasa’s force- something they managed with an ease that troubled him.  But the bright, abstract lines of paint on the Kurus’ faces, their snarling battle growls and their laconic demeanor did nothing to quench Sudasa’s mistrust.  

	“I happily welcome a Bharata royal to my Kingdom,” continued King Janmejaya, spreading his arms wide.  “My men were only coming to escort you to Kurukshetra- my capital.  But circumstances compelled them to rush you here, to Rohitaka.  I trust your captivity has not been too troublesome, Crown Prince Sudasa?  I made way to Rohitaka was fast as I could, and I apologize for keeping your men bound the entire night.  It was a necessity, however.”

	Sudasa could not decide whether King Janmejaya’s earnestness was sincere or not.  He knew nothing of the Kurus- never having heard their name before.  Were they even Arya, or were they Rakshasa?

	“Kurus,” said King Janmejaya, sensing Sudasa’s thoughts.  “From the great ancestor Kuru, who was born to a daughter in the line of Karusaka.”

	Sudasa hid his surprise and said calmly, “Karusaka- son of Vaivasvat Manu.”

	“Indeed!”  Said King Janmejaya happily.  “You know your history, young Crown Prince.”  He was a beefy man with deep, brown eyes and an auburn, frizzy beard.  Sudasa spotted the distinct patterns of paint on his left cheek- different and more ornate than the paint on any other Kuru.  The design was clearly meant to intimidate, but King Janmejaya’s easy amiability negated much of that.

	“What is the intention behind our capture, King Janmejaya?”  Sudasa asked.  “And what do you intend to do with my men?  My head will be enough for the Purus, you need not hand my entire force over to them.”

	King Janmejaya frowned in confusion.  “Hand you over to the Purus?”  He repeated.  “That is ridiculous, dear Sudasa.  Why would I hand you over to the Purus?  Why would I even deal with them?  As I have said, I only meant to have an earnest, peaceful conversation with you.  For you have not heard the second part of our tribe’s history.”

	There was sincerity in King Janmejaya’s eyes, and Sudasa found himself believing the Kuru King’s overtures.  “Then let this be a free, peaceful sitting, King Janmejaya,” he said.  “I apologize for my rashness towards violence.  We spotted your force approaching us in the forest, and I decided to attack before your men made their first move.  But you are generous in ignoring the matter and persisting with your cordiality.  Let me return the gesture by assuring you that my men will be civilized even if you unbind them.  They and their leader was bested by your men- and the Bharatas know how to respect that.”

	King Janmejaya considered that for a while before nodding in agreement.  “A valid appeal, Crown Prince.  I shall command your men freed at once.  In fact, they are free to explore Rohitaka and our unique, inimitable forest architecture.  But you and I have much to talk about.”

	“Indeed,” agreed Sudasa.  “You were about to tell me the second half of the Kuru tale.”

	“Yes.  From his mother’s side, our ancestor Kuru was descended from Karusaka- that is the first half.  And from his father’s side, Kuru was descended in the same glorious line as yours, Crown Prince.  Kuru was the son of King Samvarna- grandson to Ajamidha and cousin to your ancestor, Vena.”

	This time Sudasa could not hide his surprise.  “Samvarna of the Forests!”  He exclaimed.  “Samvarna was defeated by Hastina, and his body was never found, King Janmejaya.”

	“Samvarna retreated into the forest,” explained Janmejaya, “Shamed by his defeat at the hands of a Puru.  In Khandakvana he spent the rest of his life, and in Khandakvana he fathered Kuru.  My ancestor was born to a Bharata, but he was raised by the line of Karusaka.”

	“Samvarna will return one day with a thousand sons, and reclaim his throne,” Sudasa said, repeating a legend Rshi Vasishtha once narrated to him.  “This is a common myth among us, King Janmejaya.  But your claimed connection to Samvarna is tenuous at best, and I mean you no offence by this.”

	Janmejaya smiled, almost as if he expected that reply from Sudasa.  “No offence is taken,” he said.  “But there is a simple proof for our claim, young Sudasa.  King Samvarna was pupil of the Kashi School of rshis.  His tutors were the Rajarshis Gritsamada, Shunaka and Dhanvantari.  It stands to reason that the exclusive compositions of those sages would be known only to their pupils- and their sons.  Let us recite prayers from the Kashi brand of the Veda.  I will match you syllable for syllable, meter for meter.”  

	Sudasa knew that King Janmejaya would pass that test, such was the probity on his face.  Besides, there were better ways in which the Kurus could prove their allegiance to the Bharatas.  “We are heading for war with the Purus, Dasas and Druhyus,” Sudasa said.  “Why do the Kurus lie in hiding?  If you are Bharatas, then why are your arms not adding strength to ours as we fight battle after battle?”

	There was a triumphant glow in King Janmejaya’s eyes, and a purposeful tone entered his voice.  “You bring us back to my original point, young Sudasa.  I sent my royal guard to escort you to Kurukshetra.  I have invited you to my private chambers in Rohitaka, and set your men free as per your request.  I did everything I could to initiate peaceful, friendly conversation between us.  And the reason for all this is simple- I believe that the time for us Kurus to hide in Khandakvana is over.  The final fight for Aryavarta has begun, and we must rise to the aid of our brethren.  We are relatives, young Sudasa.  I may be your uncle, cousin or even nephew- for I do not remember the number of generations so well, but we are both sons of Bharata.  I am yours to command.  Where would you have me turn my attention to first, the Purus or the Dasas?”
