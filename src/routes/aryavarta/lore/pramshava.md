snip: "Where did the lost sons of Manu go?  Where did they flee to when they were exiled by their brother, Ikshvaku?  We know only that the descendants of Sharyati became the Nagas at Kushasthali.  But then they were wiped out by the Haihayas, and their capital renamed Dvarika.  Of the descendants of Nabhaga, Karusaka and Narisyanta we have heard naught.  But the Pramshavas returned, and for a while they even managed to stay."

“One change of direction, and we could be headed for Avisari,” said Karandhama, the elder brother.

“And for lands we are not allowed to enter,” replied Khaninetra, the younger.  Though they were born years apart, the brothers were often mistaken for identical twins.  They had the golden, brown eyes of Vaivasvat Manu, but the other features were results of generations of nomadic existence across the continent.  Fittingly, Karandhama was taller and bulkier.  But it was Khaninetra who was the stronger, faster and more able warrior.  Both brothers knew it and each accepted it with the required amount of grace.  

“Are you afraid of being captured, brother,” taunted Karandhama.

“Not for me,” retorted Khaninetra, “but for you.  After all, you’re the elder.  By Suryavanshi law it is you who poses the danger, not me.”

“And how happy that makes you,” replied Karandhama with mock hurt.

“Well, I can’t deny that it’s fun watching you always on your toes,” conceded Khaninetra.  “I do keep telling you that the fears are unfounded though.  You think King Yuvanashva cares that we are descendants of Pramshu?  You think he even remembers that his forefather Ikshvaku once banished his brothers?”
	
“He may not,” admitted Karandhama, “but many Suryavanshi undoubtedly still do.  And now that they are surrounded by menacing neighbours from all sides, their paranoia is at an all-time high.  Any news of Pramshava descendants will incite the Suryavanshi, and Yuvanashva will have to respond.”
	
“Onwards to Nimipuri then?”
	
“Yes,” replied Karandhama.  They stirred their horses forward, and the ragged entourage followed.

“If you truly are Pramshavas, then you are most welcome here,” said King Videha Janaka, his arms spread out graciously.  

“King Yuvanashva will not be happy to hear of this.  We are still exiled from Bharatvarsha, after all,” said Khaninetra.  

“My Kingdom is in the Himalaya, and as such we do not really fall within Bharatvarsha. In any case, the Suryavanshi are indebted to the Janakas for the help we provided at the battle of Vitabhya, a hundred and fifty years ago.”  There was an affable air to Videha’s demeanour, a benevolent smile that never left his face.  

“If memory serves right,” said Karandhama, “then the Suryavanshi lost that battle.  King Prithu was forced to flee to the north of Kamyakvana.”
	
“Where the Janakas helped him lose the Yadavas and Dasyus at his tail,” countered Videha.  “And since then, we have helped defend Suryavansha territories against further attacks from the Yadavas, Dasyus, Druhyus and Turvasas.”
	
“Even as conflict has emerged in your own backyard,” said Khaninetra, referring to the recent troubles the Janaka Kingdom had faced.  “We had expected Nimipuri to be a flourishing town.”
  	
Videha’s expression grew grave at that.  “Yes,” he said, “a most unfortunate event.  Our alliance with the Gandharvas and Yakshas did not go well with the Apsaras.  Seven hundred people were killed in the invasion of Nimipuri, and hundreds of Gandharvas and Yakshas as well.  Now their survivors have returned to the trans-Himalaya seeking vengeance, and I have made a new capital for myself.”
	“And what a town it is,” commented Khaninetra.  “It’s unlike any I’ve ever seen.  How did your workers manage to carve the mountain such?”
	“It was hard work,” replied Videha, “and took more than two years.  But worth it, don’t you think?  Videha is inaccessible from any direction save the uphill climb from south.  I’d like to see the Apsaras try and invade us now!  But enough about me and my city, I want to hear more from you.  Tell me all, beginning from Pramshu himself.  Where did he go?  Where did he make his home?  Where did he die?”
	Karandhama had to chuckle at that.  Videha’s amiability was so genuine and refreshing, in complete contrast to the world of strife and conflict they were used to.  Here was a King content with one city for his entire Kingdom!  “Even we are not certain of that anymore,” he replied. “But we were told in childhood that after exile Pramshu travelled far west, to the point where the great western sea curves inland and forms a gulf.  A town still survives there by the name of Ur, but we have never been there.  Pramshu always intended to form an army and invade again, but he only managed the former.  He is said to have died en route, in the city of Haroivaha.  That is where we were born.”
	Videha’s eyes lit up excitedly.  “Haroivaha, the distant Dasyu city!”  He exclaimed.  “Describe it to me.”
	“We remember little of it,” said Khaninetra.  “Our father, Rambha, migrated to a city called Aspasoi far north of Haroivaha when I was five and Karandhama, ten.”
	“Aspasoi,” Videha said, frowning.  “I’ve never heard that name, where exactly is this city and who rules there?”
	“I doubt if the city would appear on any map in Bharatvarsha, King Videha,” Khaninetra replied.  “It lies on the banks of the Vakshu River, which itself flows by north of Ashvaka territory.  As for who rules there, that is precisely why our father migrated to Aspasoi; for it is ruled by those who call themselves the Shakas- descendants of Narisyanta.”
	Videha Janaka exclaimed loudly at that, appearing most sincerely pleased.  “Narisyanta, his descendants still live!”
	“And prosper,” replied Karandhama.  “They are numerous in number, cousins and uncles and nephews all.  There is no single King among them, for they are more a confederate of tribes.  Narisyanta’s descendants have interbred with the native tribes around Aspasoi, all bound enough by blood to stand united against an outside enemy.”
	“Fascinating,” commented Videha.  “What is their sustenance?”
	“Nomadic pastoralism,” replied Karandhama matter-of-factly.  “That is still the way of life in those lands, King Videha.”
	Videha nodded, clearly looking impressed.  “And how many years did you stay at Aspasoi?”  He asked.
	“Seven,” replied Karandhama.  “That was when the first major split happened amongst the Shakas- rivalry between three brothers.  They went on to form their own tribes.  We had to leave Aspasoi then, for when Shakas fight among themselves then outsiders better be as far away as possible.”
	“So where did you go next?”
	Karandhama smiled.  He was enjoying Videha’s curiosity, and he knew what the King’s reaction would be to what he said next.  Even Khaninetra was grinning expectantly when he said, “Dvishani, home to the descendants of another son of Manu.”

“Push,” he groaned.
	“Pull,” he protested.
	“I am!”
	He gave a final grunt and yanked the rope with all his strength, managing to pull his partner up the edge.  Both lay there, panting.  Then he said, “No one told me the city was a damn mountain!”
	“And I had all the knowledge, right?”
	“Always the rough tongue with you, Meva,” he said.
	“Rough tongue and sharp blade, that’s me,” said Meva.
	“Sheath the former and prepare the latter,” he said, getting up and dusting himself.  “Let’s go.”  Meva followed, and together they entered the mountain city of Videha.
***
“The Druhyus no longer are a single Kingdom,” informed Khaninetra.  “They are split into various city-states, all claiming descent from the original Druhyu.  We happened to pass by the abandoned city of Mohanjodvara once, nothing alive remained there even as much of the city was untouched.  It was as if the people there had simply left.”
	Videha nodded knowingly.  “It is a known story in Bharatvarsha,” he said, looking pleased to have something to share in return.  “At the battle of Vitabhya, King Prithu sent his fleet to attack Mohanjodvara.  King Druhyu returned to save it, but he arrived too late.  Prithu’s fleet had already been there, and had given the six thousand citizens the option to flee unharmed; most had accepted that offer. Prithu’s men had then proceeded to raze the city to the ground.”
	“What did Druhyu do next?”  Asked Khaninetra.
	“Return to Sivobheda dejected,” replied Videha, “and half a Kingdom less than what he left with.  Mohanjodvara is a cursed city, and none have chosen to settle there again.  Even Sivobheda is dead now, destroyed by a terrible flooding of the Sarasvati River.  But tell me of these Druhyu city-states, how many of them are there?”
	“Tough to say,” replied Karandhama.  “They keep consolidating and fragmenting among themselves.  But we visited a powerful one on the banks of the Lorikdanai River, between where it branches off into the Arkatasi and Turnaki.  It’s called Gandhara, founded and ruled by a Druhyu of the same name much like you, King Videha.”
	Videha appeared defensive.  “No harm in naming your capital after yourself,” he said.  “Even Bharatvarsha is named after that legendary King of the First Manvantara.”
	“I only meant it as a compliment,” Karandhama said warily.
	“Then I only took it as such,” replied Videha in good humour.  “Tell me more of Gandhara.  What does it trade in?  How are the people there?  Do they worship the Daevas?”
	They had settled into a steady rhythm of conversation now, and Karandhama allowed himself a pleasant laugh before replying.
***
“This way,” he said.
	“No, this way,” argued Meva.
	“How do you know?”  He challenged.
	“How do you?”
	He sighed, Meva had a point after all.  “All right,” he said, “let’s go your way.”
	So they took the left tunnel, which sloped downwards instead of up.  They had climbed the city only with great difficulty, and now Meva insisted that the way sloping back down was correct.
	“Smells like piss,” Meva commented, wrinkling his nose as they scampered down the tunnel, backs bent over.
	“They piss in the snow,” he snapped, “and the snow melts through to these tunnels.  That’s what you smell.”
	“Interesting theory, acharya,” Meva taunted.  “Have you thought about how we’ll recognize them?”
	“Let’s find people first, any people,” he replied.  “Then we’ll think of recognizing them.”
	“Ah, the-take-it-as-it-comes-type,” Meva commented.  “Interesting.”
	“Your back is to me, I must remind you,” he said in a warning tone.
	“The great assassin Khara is a man of even greater honour, that is what I’ve heard,” Meva said.  “He will not stab me in the back.”
	It was true enough, so Khara followed in silence.

“So you took the route south of Kalpavana, passed through the town of Madra and made for the Mansarovara Lake via Plaksha,” Videha confirmed.
	Both brothers nodded.  “From there we turned south-east and headed for Nimipuri,” Khaninetra added.  
	“A long, dangerous and arduous journey,” Videha said, clearly impressed.  “And you say that there are four hundred men with you?”
	“More than six hundred since we first set out from Gandhara,” Khaninetra said with sadness, looking to his brother.  “But we lost many on the way from there to Kamyakvana, and then more during the journey through the Himalaya.”
	“A tragedy,” said Videha, looking equally sad.  “But then I must ask the question that has been foremost on my mind.”
	“And what question is that, King Videha?”  Karandhama asked.
	“All this,” Videha said, spreading out his arms, “is to what end?  Why are you here, Pramshavas?  A force of four hundred men means little in Bharatvarsha these days.  Powerful Kingdoms flourish- Purus in Pratisthana, ruled by King Matinara; Yadavas from Ekachakra to Dvarika, holding monopoly over most of the metal trade; the Anavas in the far-east, ruled by King Mahasala who currently commands Bharatvarsha’s most formidable navy; and don’t forget the Suryavansha, who may hold sway over a smaller territory now but are still the continent’s strongest army.”
	“But we are of Bharatvarsha, King Videha,” Karandhama said, Khaninetra nodding beside him.  “This is the land of our forefathers, or are we not Manavas just like you and the Suryavansha?”
	“You are,” agreed Videha, “or you would not find hospitality in my city.  But what are your intentions?  Will you find a nice farm for yourselves and live in anonymity, or have the Pramshavas returned to stake a claim on Bharatvarsha?”
	Karandhama smiled.  “We have no interest in your Kings and your Kingdoms,” he replied.  “My brother and I are explorers, and so are the men that journey with us.  Bharatvarsha is a vast land, and half of it is still unexplored.  What lies south of the Vindhyachala?  Does the Dandakvana ever end, and if so, what lies beyond?  Finding the answers to these questions is our intent, King Videha.”
***
“Stop that,” Khara barked.
	“Stop what?” Meva replied innocently.
	“The humming, I hate it.”
	“Hate?”  Meva remarked.  “Hate is such a strong word, my assassin friend.  It may annoy you sure, but hate?”
	“Just keep walking,” Khara said, feeling as if he would be unable to tolerate Meva’s banter anymore.  For a moment, he speculated whether it would have been better to let him fall down the mountain.  He could certainly have found his way through the caverns himself, and he could manage the small matter of an assassination himself too.
	“What’re you thinking?”  Meva asked.
	“How do you know I was thinking?”  Khara asked, instantly on alert.  He hated sorcery and magic of any kind.
	Meva stopped and turned around, looking absurd stooped as he was.  “Rshi Khara!”  He exclaimed.  “A seer of such great power!  Look at his mental control, he can stop the flow of thoughts itself!”  He grinned stupidly, turned back around and continued walking down the tunnel.
	Khara almost whipped out his knife, but right then the tunnel sloped gently upwards.  Then the slope became steeper and the tunnel wider.  Finally there emerged a gaping hole above them, and they had to dig their fingers into tiny crevices to climb their way up.  All along the ascent, Meva hummed most irritably.

“I must reiterate that you maintain anonymity,” insisted Videha.  “There are many that would easily reveal your secret to King Yuvanashva simply to gain small favour from the Suryavansha.  You took enough a risk by revealing your identities to me, for as his ally I am honour-bound to turn you over to him.”
	“But you won’t?”  Asked Karandhama.
	“I won’t, for the bond of blood is higher than any promises I have made.  By blood, I owe Yuvanashva no more or less than I owe you.”
	“You owe us nothing, King Videha,” assured Karandhama.
	“I owe it to my ancestors, to my dharma,” insisted Videha sagely.  This was a Janaka after all, both brothers remarked to themselves.  “Come now, I have badgered you enough for today.  The attendant will guide you to your quarters.  Please treat my city as your city, you are free to explore as much as you wish.  There is no area that is out of bounds for you.”
	“That is most generous of you, King Janaka,” bowed Karandhama.  Videha Janaka got up and embraced both brothers dearly.  Then he signaled to the aide who stepped forward and gestured for the Pramshavas to follow him.  King Videha retreated to his private chamber while the brothers were led to a large, opulent hall with the most ornate carvings on the walls.  Two wide beds lined one wall, several cushions placed over a deep, cotton mattress.  Fruits, nuts, wines and water were placed on a table between the beds and a doorway on another wall led to an equally opulent washroom.  
	“There is a bell by your beds, sires,” the attendant said before leaving.  “Please ring it if you have any need.”
***
“King Videha will host them close to his quarters,” Meva said.  “He is famous for affording his guests luxuries that even he does not indulge in.”
	“Yes, yes,” Khara replied lazily, “the Janaka Kings are all saints.”
	“You know your politics, assassin,” Meva remarked.  “Is that what makes you so good?”
	“I keep my mouth shut, do what I have to and get out of there.  That’s what makes me so good.”
	Meva turned and brought a finger to his lips, pointing silently towards the doorway ahead of them.  They put their backs to the wall, black cloaks making them invisible in the shadow.  Khara found that Meva moved as swiftly and silently as he did.  They crept ahead, backs stuck to the wall.  A faint, flickering light emerged through the doorway.  Meva stopped and tentatively held his neck out, peering into the doorway and standing back straight a few moments later.  
	“It’s them,” he whispered coarsely.
	“How do you know?” Khara whispered back.
	“It has to be them,” Meva said, voice barely audible.  “Videha has one son, and he currently resides with the Suryavanshi.  No other young men would be so close to the King’s private quarters.  And it’s two of them, just like the brothers we are here to kill.”
	“If it’s not them, we may lose the chance entirely.”
	“If it’s not them, we cover their bodies and move to the next room,” Meva replied with deathly confidence, making Khara wonder whether his companion was as cavalier as he appeared.
	“I’ll take lead,” Khara said and moved ahead of Meva.  He took a moment to peer inside the room and find the two figures sleeping on the beds.  “I’ll take the left one, you take the right,” he said.
	“Let’s do it,” Meva replied, cheerily but hushed.
	Khara brought out his blade and checked its cut, it was as sharp as ever.  He crouched and stealthily entered the room, confident that Meva was behind him.  But as soon as he had taken a few steps inside, cloaked figures emerged from the darkness all around him.  In an instant Khara realized two things- one, that seven spears were pointed at him, their ends gleaming under the light of the candles; two, that Meva had not followed him inside.
***
Another punch landed hard on his cheek, threatening to break his jaw open.  
	“Speak, man, or this will have to continue,” King Janaka insisted.  “Who sent you, and why?”
	Khara collected some more blood in his mouth and spat it out at the feet of the soldier that had punched him.  To the King’s credit, he truly did appear not to be enjoying the torture.  But an assassination attempt had been made against guests inside his house, right next to where he slept.  Khara understood that the torture was necessary.
	The soldier punched him again, this time on the other cheek.  His jaw snapped from one side to the other and blood spurted out, soiling the feet of the soldiers that surround him.
	“He was sent to kill us,” Karandhama said, “that much is obvious.  But who, that is all I want to know.”
	The soldier dealt another blow, and then another before a voice broke out, “My King, enough of the blade.  Now try the flower.”
	“What do you suggest, Kirti?”  King Janaka asked.
	“Clearly violence has no effect on this man,” the voice said.  “Look at him, he is a cold-blooded assassin.  Such men prepare themselves exactly for situations like this.”
	“Kirti is my minister of trade,” said Janaka to the Pramshava brothers.  
Kirti bowed to the brothers.  “Like my King, I am deeply sorry about this.”  To Janaka he said, “And who are these guests, King Janaka?”
	“They are Suryavanshi princes,” Janaka replied quickly.  “You were saying something about trying the flower, Kirti?”
	“Yes,” Kirti said.  “I say we offer this man his life and freedom, in return for full information on those that hired him.”  Kirti’s eyes turned to Khara now and rested on him.  “Perhaps he has a family and would like to go back to them, or perhaps he has personal scores to settle.  Either way, life and freedom is an enticing incentive.  It would open his mouth, instead of breaking it as your soldier seems intend to do.”
	“Very well,” Janaka said, “you heard him man, speak the truth now.  My word is inviolable, if I promise you freedom then that is what you will have.  Tell us who sent you.”
	Khara chanced a glance towards Kirti, who returned the faintest of nods; or perhaps Khara only imagined it.  But Kirti had given him exactly what he was looking for.  He hadn’t withheld the name of those who hired him out of any sense of honour, it was simply bad business sense to hand over your end of the bargain without having anything promised in return.  But now that had been done, thanks to Kirti.
	“I was hired by the King Trsanu, ruler of the lands between Sikardu and Uraga,” he confessed.
	The brothers turned to King Janaka for explanation.  “Trsanu is a Turvasa,” Janaka informed them.  “The towns of Sikardu and Uraga, indeed the entire Turvasa territory are the Suryavansha’s north-east neighbour.  No doubt Trsanu intended to present your deaths to Yuvanashva to gain Suryavanshi favour.  His is a sparse and ill-equipped army, dangerously vulnerable to the bands of Yakshas, Rakshasas and Gandharvas that still remain in those parts.”
	“A sparse army you say,” said Karandhama, his gaze never lifting away from Khara.  “How sparse?  How many fighting men does this Trisanu command?”  Beside him, Khaninetra mirrored his brother’s determined look, for he knew what Karandhama had already decided.
	“No more than six or seven hundred strong,” replied Janaka.
	“To further his own aim, this Turvasa King will trade the lives of those who have done nothing to him?”  Karandhama asked, not wanting to believe.
	Janaka shrugged sadly.  “That is the way, Pramshava.  I warned you of this, that this is what you will face if your identity is to become public.  There is still time, retreat into anonymity or better yet, leave Bharatvarsha altogether.”
	“I intend the opposite, King Videha,” Karandhama said, still staring at Khara.  “The four hundred men with us have been gathered from among Shakas, Dasyus and various other wild tribes.  We are one of them, and we do not take things like this lying down.  This one,” he indicated towards Khara, “can guide us back to Turvasa territory.”
	“What do you mean, are you going to attack Sikardu?”  Janaka asked.
	“And Uraga,” Khaninetra said.
	“That is a mistake,” Janaka said, though not with force.  “It will take a few hours for Yuvanashva to completely crush your forces, and be sure that he will do exactly this when he hears of your presence.  The Suryavansha Kings are bound by the words of Ikshvaku, their first.  And his words were clear- that his brothers and their descendants were not to set foot east of the Sindhu ever again.”
	“We will see about that when we come to it,” Khaninetra replied for both the brothers.  “But the Turvasas must be destroyed.”
