> Mathura gives us a strategic advantage.  If we can cross the Yamuna from there, we cut the Bharata Kingdom in half.  No matter how the war goes, Mathura must be held.<br><cite>King Kanaka to King Kuruvasa, Planning for the Battle of Ten Kings</cite>

Gopala lazily blew on the flute, making no attempt to stay in tune.  The flute emitted broken, hoarse sounds while he continued oblivious to how annoyed his friend looked.

	“Stop it, will you?”  Said Anuratha, sounding as lazy as Gopala’s flute.  It was a hot, dry day with absolutely no breeze.  Even the cows preferred to eat short and quick before the sun was fully up in the sky.  Now they rested beneath the trees, waiting for the heat of the day to pass and the cool evening to arrive before heading back to the village.  Some of the older cows opted to lie in the pond, seemingly okay with the sun as long as there was water to submerge in.  Anuratha waded in after them but emerged out just as quick, claiming with distaste that the water was hot and sludgy.  

	Gopala obliged and put his flute aside.  “Hard to believe that only a few months ago we were holding swords and fighting for our lives,” he said.

	“Easy for you to say,” said Anuratha.  “I still have the limp.”

	“By no one’s fault but yours,” replied Gopala, idly throwing the flute at Anuratha.  It was the village joke that Anuratha’s leg was crushed by his own horse as he dismounted.  

	“Well, limp or not I can still beat you to the ground,” said Anuratha.

	“Smart move,” replied Gopala, “making that challenge when I am in the laziest of moods.”

	At that Anuratha bolted up, favouring his right, good leg for weight.  

	“Stop it, will you?”  Said Gopala, mirroring his friend’s earlier plea.  “Let’s leave it for the training ground.”  As an afterthought, he added, “When we build one.”

	Anuratha motioned for Gopala to be silent, a frown upon his face.  Gopala frowned too when he realized that his friend was being serious.  He strained his ears to hear the sound of hooves in the distance, and turned to Anuratha.  For a moment the two friends stared at each other, their eyes meeting and comprehending.  Then, in a flash Gopala shot up and bounded towards the cows.  Anuratha began climbing the tree, the limp in his leg forgotten.  

	Gopala roared and blared, pushing the indignant cows off the ground.  The ones in the water began walking back instantly, experience a part of them as much as it was a part of their two cowherds.  Watching them and still prodded by Gopala’s stick, the other cows finally got in line and began reluctantly trudging back towards the village.  Gopala pushed the last of them away and joined Anuratha at the base of the tree.  Anuratha handed him his sword and shield before arming his own.  The sound of hooves was unmistakable now, and pretty soon the five horsemen were visible.  Both friends tensed, the afternoon’s lethargy long gone from their bones.  They walked out confidently in the direction of the approaching horses.

	As they approached, Gopala’s attention went to the details.  Their approach was from the north, so they were likely from Bharatpura.  The horses were old and slow, their blades were without sheaths and there were no shields upon their backs.  These were not men from any army, even a fringe division.  These were bandits, wild men who went from village to village raiding and taking their pick.  Untrained, predictable and rash men, and the two friends had taken on far worse.

	Anuratha put his hand out in a halting gesture as the men neared, looking every bit the prince that he was.  Gopala stood beside his friend, though it was the loyal bodyguard in him that now held his sword.  The men slowed their horses, annoyance clear on their faces.

	“And who would you two be, to foolishly stand in the path of approaching horses?”  Asked the lead man.

	“Guards of Mathura,” Anuratha replied confidently.  “And you need permission to pass.”

	The men laughed mockingly, exchanging sneers among themselves.  “Mathura!”  Exclaimed the leader.  “Now that’s a name we haven’t heard before!  What town is this, cowherd?”

	“It is a village,” Anuratha said, “a village of cowherds and farmers.  And you need permission to pass.”

	“Enough,” snapped the leader.  “Stand aside now, little man.  Or I will find your family first.”

	That was what Gopala was waiting for.  In a flash he took two leaps towards the leader and slashed his sword at the man’s throat.  He reared his horse in alarm but Gopala’s sword was long and sharp.  Even as the other men roared, the leader fell to the ground bleeding from the throat.  Anuratha used that time to circle around and approach the men from behind.  He kicked the horse of one and cut his sword through another man’s waist.  The first man’s horse sprinted at the kick, but the second man remarkably did not fall.  He turned his horse around, agonized but angry.  Anuratha took a few steps back as another man turned his horse around to face him.  Further ahead of him, Gopala made quick work of the fifth man, but the man whose horse had sprinted away now took back control and darted at Gopala.  Gopala in turn sprinted at one of the man facing Anuratha and leaped in the air, roaring, “Hara Vrishni!”

	Both the men facing Anuratha looked in Gopala’s direction, and Anuratha shook his head smiling.  Gopala’s roar succeeded in distracting them for just those few crucial moments.  It took Anuratha no time to run at the one whose waist he had cut through, this time running from the other side and slicing from the other direction.  The man roared in agony and fell off his horse, nearly dismembered from his lower half.  Meanwhile, Gopala leaped again and slashed his sword right through another man’s skull.  As both friends recovered from their kills and regained their posture, they turned their attention to the last man.  He looked at Gopala, sneering.  

	Ignoring Anuratha, the man charged his horse again while Gopala tensed, ready to leap away at the last moment.  But before that time came, Anuratha’s sword cut through the air and right across the man’s throat.  Gopala leapt to the right to evade the horse, which sprinted a few paces ahead before slowing down and ambling aimlessly.  The last man fell to the ground and like his leader, gurgled his blood out to death.  

	Anuratha walked up to Gopala and extended his hand out, helping his friend to his feet.  Gopala got up and dusted himself, vigorously shaking his head to get the dust out of his hair.  They looked around at the dead men and trudging horses, looking grim and sombre.  “This is just the beginning you know,” Gopala said softly, “more will come.”

	Anuratha sighed and looked to the distance in the direction of Mathura.  “And they will keep coming,” he said, “from every direction.  Mathura has to learn to defend itself.”

	“Tell your father that,” Gopala said.  “Chief Mathu is convinced that we can lead a peaceful life from now on.”

	“And we can, for a while,” replied Anuratha.  “It will be some time before Mathura finds the attention of anyone but rogue bandits.  Think of it as training, my dear friend.  Then, when the time is right and the Bharatas turn their attention to us, we can think of convincing my father.  Till then, let the retired soldiers of the Yadava army live their simple, cowherd lives.”

**4246 B.C.**

In the Council of the Grand Bharata Kingdom, there was an ominous silence.  The four Bharata Kings brooded over their strength and limitations, none of them willing to break the silence.  The meeting was in Kampilya, the fortress-city on the western banks of the Ganga.  Of the four it was Srinjaya who ruled here, as he did in Prayaga as well.  There was Divodasa II, King of Kashi, and Gathin, King of both Kanyakubja and Kaushambhi.  Finally, there was their tall and fair-skinned cousin, Vardhryashva, son of the great King Mudgala and King of Ahikshetra.  These were the men who had inherited the Grand Bharata Kingdom built by the first of their lines- Bharata, Suhotra, Sunahotra, Brhat, Ajamidha, Kasha and Jahnu.  It was a Kingdom that began from the ancient towns of Prasthala and Sakala in the north, ran through the equally old Trigarta and Vinasana across countless towns such as Bharatpura, Pramana Koti and Yamaprastha to the younger centers of glory- Kampilya, Kanyakubja, Prayaga, Kaushambhi and Kasha.

	It gave these four men the combined strength of nine thousand soldiers, three thousand elephants and five thousand horsemen apart from their two thousand chariots- reserved for the highest levels of military and royal dynasty.  Theirs would the largest army ever assembled in Bharatvarsha, and now the time for that was coming near.

	“Yadavas to the west, Haihayas to the east, Purus and Turvasas to the north and Dasyus to the far west.  It is only a matter of time before they turn their attention to us all at once,” said Srinjaya.  “And of all of us, it is Yavinara who is most vulnerable.”  Yavinara was the fifth Bharata King, ruler of entire tract of land between Sakala and Trigarta, Prasthala and Vinasana.  He was absent for he had to deal with the latest threat from a tribe calling itself the Uttarakuru, but the Bharata Kings had not turned their attention to that, yet.

	“It is the Yadavas we must deal with first,” said Gathin, whose river-crossing city of Kanyakubja forever dealt with the shadow of Ekachakra to the west.   

	“Yes, but which sub-clan?” Asked Divodasa II.  “Haihaya Yadavas rule all that was once Suryavanshi and Anava from Sravasti to Girivraja.  The Sattvatas abound from Ekachakra to Vidarbha, and now there is news of these Vrishni Yadavas and some village of Mathura.”  

	“Mathura is insignificant,” said Srinjaya confidently.  “After the Haihayas took over Ayodhya, and large section of their army retired, fed up with their warring ways.  Those men are cowherds and farmers now, not warriors.  And their number would be no more than some three hundred, a single contingent from Kampilya or Bharatpura can take them out.”

	Divodasa II was not convinced by his cousin’s easy confidence.  He was a young man of twenty years when the Haihayas had attacked the Suryavanshi.  For six days the cities of Ayodhya and Kosala had burnt, and for six days their smoke was visible from Kashi.  In the fourteen years hence he had lived under the Haihaya shadow, watching Kashi’s economy wane after trade had stopped coming in from downstream the Ganga and resources were increasingly devoted to military expenditures.  

	“Why wait for it to gain strength and numbers then?”  Asked Gathin, his narrowed eyes giving him an even gaunter look.  Of the five Bharata Kings, Gathin had seen the most war and death.  Kaushambhi was a golden city in the forests, eternally at war with the numerous forest tribes south of its borders.  And as King of Kanyakubja he had waged countless battles with both the Yadavas and the now-lost Suryavanshi.  His was a sharp, tactical mind.  He looked to Srinjaya and said, “You or I could easily send a contingent to Mathura.  Let us route the place and claim it for the Grand Bharata Kingdom.”

	Srinjaya’s eyes narrowed shrewdly as well.  “It would give us a vast tactical advantage over Ekachakra,” he said.

	“And it would strike first blood,” said Divodasa II.  “The Yadavas will not let it go unanswered.  Are we sure we want to get into this war right now?”

	“We have always been at war,” said Gathin, “right from Great King Bharata himself.  Now is simply the time we finally take the attack to the enemy.”

The reluctant King of Mathura looked sadly at the refugees in his hall, unsure of what to do with them.  The father was as emaciated as his children, his long hair and beard dirty and disheveled beyond belief.  They wore tattered, sparse robes and looked at him with pleading eyes.

	“What am I to do with you, Sagara of the Suryavanshi,” said King Mathu contemplatively.  That was what this man has introduced himself as, claiming to be a son of Bahu, the lost and defeated Suryavanshi King.  Sagara with his dozen sons, all with blazing orange eyes.  

	“Allow me passage, that is all I ask of you, King Mathu,” said Sagara, his parched throat lending him a hoarse, painful voice.  “Let me take my children back to Sravasti and Ayodhya, so that we may die in lands that are rightfully ours.”

	“That is certainly what will happen to you, Sagara, if you are seen anywhere near Haihaya territory.  And that is what Ayodhya and Sravasti are now,” Mathu said.  That was his dilemma- whether to let this man and his son to their fate and simply acquiesce to his request, or to consider their actual benefit and turn them elsewhere, somewhere safe.

	“I care not,” snapped Sagara, with remarkable strength given his apparent condition.  “You do not own the Yamuna, King Mathu.  You cannot deny me and my sons passage across it.”

	   “I own the bridges that run over it and across the islands that lie in it,” Mathu said calmly, only to argue with the man.  If this was the way he would understand, then so be it.

	“My sons and I have use for none of that,” said Sagara, standing up tall and proud.  “We will swim across the Yamuna.”

	Mathu stared at the stubborn father and his sons, the eldest of whom looked not more than fourteen.  They certainly had the famed Suryavanshi pride, he mused to himself.  And Sagara did not look like he was ready to relent.  There were Yadava Kingdoms were such refugees would be instantly beheaded or worse, enslaved.  But this was a small town of Vrishni Yadavas, men who loved peace, farming and cowherding over anything else.  Seven hundred men and women, to be precise, and five hundred of them were capable veterans of war.  The same war that had defeated the Suryavanshi King Bahu and ousted him and his people from their lands.  Mathu had fought that war on the Haihaya side, bound loyally by his Yadava blood.  He was there when the Suryavanshi banners were taken off the ramparts and turrets of Ayodhya to be replaced by Haihaya ones.  But Sagara knew none of that, and it was better that way.

	Mathu decided that he would grant this Suryavanshi his wish, and he was about to say so when Anuratha and Gopala barged into the hall, out of breath and sweating all over.  “What is it?”  Mathu asked, frowning.  

	“A Bharata contingent approaches the eastern bank of the Yamuna, and it looks like it is headed right for Mathura,” said Anuratha.  At forty-two, he was old enough to be a King himself, but what father would want to bestow upon his son a Kingdom of one village.  

	“Cavalry?”  Mathu asked, wasting no time in pointless queries.

	“None was sighted,” Anuratha replied confidently, and Gopala nodded next to him.  These were the capable generals of Mathura’s army, and Mathu knew from their tense bearing that battle was truly at their doorstep.  

	Mathu looked to Sagara.  “It looks like you will not be able to use the bridges anyway, Sagara Suryavanshi,” he said.  “We cannot protect you here, and I cannot predict what the Bharatas would do if they get their hands on you and your sons.  I release you to your own fate.  Swim across the Yamuna if that is what you must do, but escape from Mathura before the Bharatas are upon us.”

***

“Are these men really from the Bharata army?”  Anuratha asked disbelievingly.  They were making easy work of the enemy, which so far had seemed disorganized and undertrained.  The Bharatas had sent a contingent of four hundred men, only slightly outnumbered by Mathura’s strength.  But the battle had been decidedly one-sided in their favour right from the start.

	“Either we have overestimated the Bharatas,” Gopala replied between grunts and slashes of his sword, “or they have underestimated us!”

	The two friends moved in perfect unison, using the two-man attack stances that were a part of their very instinct.  Rotating turns, one man slashed and cut while the other blocked and parried.  Their forward motion took them in an arc across the battlefield, driving the wedge between the enemy formations and pushing them into circles of Mathuran warriors.  On the other side of the field, King Mathu and his younger son directed the battle from their chariots, the only two in Mathura’s possession.  The Bharatas on the other hand, had waded into the battle without a single chariot.  The very field on which their cows grazed were now red with blood and gristle, and the battle continued well into the evening.  

	Mathura had lost half his army by the time the Bharatas decided to retreat and flee north, running to sanctuary at the outpost of Bharatpura.  Mathu and his sons walked along the field, tending to their wounded and bringing quick death to the enemy soldiers still moaning in their own blood.  Mathura had won this battle, but how would it survive the next?
