“Ikshvaku returned to Avisari and found his city besieged.  His army had to plough their way into Avisari by slaying fellow Suryavanshi soldiers.  In the end, Ikshvaku himself killed members of the royal guard to reach his brothers in Avisari’s main halls.”

	“And what happened to the brothers?”  Sudasa asked.

	“What is often forgotten in the tale of Ikshvaku,” said Rshi Vasishtha, “Is that he was in fact a pacifist King.  Violence and war never pleased him, and he only unsheathed his sword with reluctance.  Splattered as he was with the blood of his kin when he waded his way into the royal court at Avisari, he could not bring himself to kill is own brothers.  Instead he exiled them, sending them to places far beyond the borders of Aryavarta.  Pramshu was last heard of from a long way in the distant west- a place called Ur.  The descendants of Sharyati were called the Nagas, and they survived for a while in cities such as Raivata and Kushasthali before the Yadavas wiped them out.  Of Nabhaga and Karusaka we know nothing, but the sons of Narisyanta formed the north-western tribe we call Shakas.”

	“The blood of Manu has travelled far and wide,” Sudasa said, echoing something he had heard in childhood.

	“Indeed,” concurred Rshi Vasishtha.  “This is why even the western tribes call themselves Manava, or some variant of that.”

	“And what happened to Ikshvaku after the war?”	

	“He set out to consolidate his Kingdom and strengthen his borders.  The rebellion made him all but forget the Dasas to the west, including the mysterious disappearance of Narantaka.  This would prove to be most fatal.”

**Year 64, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

Rajavasa- Abode of the King.  This was a city that had sprung from scratch in two years.  Once the rebellion was quelled and his brothers exiled, Ikshvaku set his mind to building a new capital for his son, the crown-prince.  Avisari was too far away from his Kingdom, Ikshvaku finally decided.

	A large swathe of the Kamyakvana was cleared to build the city, between the Asikni and Iravati rivers.  It was planned in a grid fashion, streets and avenues clearing their way through standard form, multi-storied dwellings.  At the southern end of Rajavasa lay the Great Bath, an artificial pond of water irrigated from the Iravati.  Drains ran between every dwelling, and carried the waste into the marshes that lined the western banks of the Asikni.  From the Great Bath, open and wide canals carried fresh river water into the farms outside the city’s four walls.  Here, the farms were interspersed with markets, trading godowns, storage wells and an unplanned growth of residential quarters.  Inside the four walls, at the north-west corner was the great and perennial altar, the Suryavedi.  A school of rshis maintained the fires of the Suryavedi day and night, and had been doing so for two years now- even through rain and storm.  As long as the flames of the Suryavedi were alit, people were declaring, the Suryavansha dynasty would never waver.  Towards the north-east corner was the cowshed, and its attached market had already gained fame as the seller of fine milk and sweets. 

	South of the city’s borders was still dense forest, home to countless predators, wild beasts and swamps.  Prince Nimi, Ikshvaku’s twenty-two year old second born, preferred his time in Rajavasa’s cowshed.  The gentle cows brought him solace, with their content but productive living.  He enjoyed spending his mornings bathing the cows and then feeding them their breakfast grasses.  This was followed by cleaning up the fresh batch of cattle droppings, and delivering it to Rajavasa’s mining cluster outside the main walls.  The miners were set to an important task by King Ikshvaku, for it was on them to produce the bronze that would go into the life size model of Crown Prince Vikukshi.  

	Primogeniture or not, Nimi was content to allow the throne to Vikukshi.  But ever since Ikshvaku’s own brothers had rebelled against him, the King had grown suspicious of Nimi’s intents.  He kept his younger son at an arm’s length now, and Nimi was forbidden from receiving martial or political training.  He remembered the day vividly, when King Ikshvaku made it clear that Nimi would never come close to any sort of power.  It had upset Haryashva and the Ashvakas, for through his mother, Nimi carried Ashvaka blood.  That was the only time he really saw his father angry, Ikshvaku had always been a calm, temperate if detached presence in his life.  As a final seal of approval, even Maharshi Vasishtha had reserved his loyalties for the elder son of Ikshvaku.

	Now the Maharshi was dead, and Vikukshi was to be crowned the King.  But none of it mattered anymore, for Nimi had decided that soon, he too would disappear from the scene.  He longed to journey to the sources of the great rivers, to visit the lands beyond Himalaya and to gaze upon the Ganga and Yamuna.  He could even go north, to Sringara and beyond- to the great Soma schools set up by the Maharshi Kashyapa in his lifetime.  But he could never leave without taking his father’s permission, nor without saying farewell to Vikukshi.

	Just as he thought so, the curtains to his chambers parted and Vikukshi stepped in.  A year elder and the mirror image of their father, Vikukshi looked every bit the heir apparent.  Nimi shared the same eyes and hair, but his form and bearing was unmistakably Ashvaka.  “Will you not attend my coronation, brother?”  Vikukshi asked. 

	Nimi smiled and placed an affectionate arm on Vikukshi’s shoulder.  “Of course I will,” he replied, adding in jest, “If father doesn’t mind, that is.”

	“And are you still determined about your plan to leave after?”

	“I am.  There is no place for me here, Vikukshi.”

	“You are mistaken,” Vikukshi replied.  “There is a place for you by my side, as I have said to you before.  Father will not be able to object once I am the King.”

	“We have talked about this before, brother.”  Nimi said.  “But I do not think father would accept your decisions so easily.  He went against the wishes of his own father, when he exiled his brothers.  Why would he act any different in my case?”

	“Because you are his son,” Vikukshi replied with force.  “However he may behave with you, he loves you as much as he loves me, this I know for certain.”

	Nimi did not think that was correct, but before he could reply they heard the distant booms of a war horn.  They started at each other, the horn had not sounded Suryavanshi.

***

“It’s Rakshasas,” Haryashva confirmed.

	“How did they get so far in without us knowing?”  Ikshvaku demanded to know.

	“That troubles me as well,” Haryashva replied.  “My best guess is that they sailed up the Lorikdanai, and found a pass in the mountains that led them right to the Sindhu.  From there it would take less than a week for an army fast on the move to reach us.  They could as easily have amassed forces in and around the pass itself, biding their time while we battled your brothers.  Splinter groups could have slipped into Kamyakvana while we were within the walls of Avisari all those years ago.”

	“How many of them are there?”  Vikukshi asked.  The Crown Prince was agitated and tense, unable to take the infinite moments of stillness that preceded a battle.  The Dasa forces had surrounded Rajavasa on its west and south sides.  When the war horns were heard in the distance, the city wall gates were opened to let inhabitants of the outer areas gather inside.  In that time, the Dasas formed lines around the eastern wall as well.  Only the northern wall remained open, and from there an unbroken chain could run all the way to Avisari.  It was a small mercy, and Haryashva muttered under his breath how they were lucky to not be trapped in a siege situation. 

	“Who knows how many lie hidden in the forest, but the scouts have counted more than three thousand,” Haryashva replied.

	Vikukshi raised his eyebrows in alarm.  “Three thousand!  But we have less than a thousand soldiers within the city walls.”

	“Which is why I have already sent riders to Avisari and Vitabhya,” Ikshvaku said.  “The latter will take time to turn round the Kamyakvana and head south, but Avisari and Kapisa can respond to us within two days.  Till then, our men will have to do.”  The King then turned to his younger son.  “Leave, this is no place for you.  Find safety, a stray arrow can take your life here.”

	“No,” Nimi said, and his father’s eyes narrowed.  “I will stand next to my father and brother.  If you fight, I will fight.”  For a flash of a second, he saw pride in his father’s eyes, then it was replaced by the usual icy stare and the King turned away.

	A lone Dasa stepped out of the line and walked towards the city wall.  When he was within the archers’ range, he dropped his weapons and walked on ahead with his arms in the air.  No archer fired, and none would till the King gave his command.  The Dasa walked all the way to the gate, and arrogantly stared up at Ikshvaku and the rest.

	“My commander, the Dasa leader Narantaka has a message for King Ikshvaku of the Suryavansha.”

	Despite the rage that ran through him, Ikshvaku was not surprised.  Narantaka had disappeared during the last guerrilla attack on Ikshvaku’s camp on the Setumanta, seven years ago.  In the years since, Ikshvaku had often heard of a new ruler in the west, by the name of Narantaka.  The old Rakshasa had forged a Kingdom for himself there, fashioning it the Haptahendu in imitation of the Suryavanshi’s Saptasindhu.  Odd priests had travelled from the banks of Parasi and Sarayu, speaking of the same Deva-Asura wars, but turning the stories upside down.  They preached of the Asuras, and proclaimed the Devas to be ignorant and false deities.  His time and resources engaged in war with his brothers, Ikshvaku had little time get to the bottom of these reports, and now Narantaka stood outside his walls, with a vast army to match his own.

	“And what is Narantaka’s message?”  Ikshvaku asked.

	“He offers to leave your city and its people alone and return to the Haptahendu, on one condition.”

	“What condition is this, Dasa?”  Growled Haryashva.

	“That the King Ikshvaku hand over both his wives and sons.  Present them to King Narantaka and we will all retreat.”  The Dasa bared his teeth in a wolfish grin, easily aware that Ikshvaku would never accept the condition.  The Dasas, it seemed, were here for war.

***

“Thrust it like this,” Vikukshi grunted as he plunged his sword up the ribs of a Dasa, and said while pulling it out- “It cuts through the heart and bleeds the man out in seconds.”  Nimi resisted the urge to gag as the Dasa died in front of them, blood gurgling out of his throat and wound.  His newfound sword hung limply, the few drops of blood trickling on it having only splashed from Vikukshi’s night-red blade.

	The brothers picked up their shields again and turned around the corner, walking back to back.  It was now four days since the Dasa attack had begun, and yet their warriors kept emerging out of the forest.  Contingents from Avisari and Kapisa were arriving every twelve hours since a day ago, but it would take up to a week before any help arrived from Vitabhya.  The Dasas were outside Rajavasa, inside Rajavasa and around Rajavasa.  Only the northern wall remained standing, and thus the link with the north.  From their vantage point on the wall, the Suryavanshi archers had been able to defend the Suryavedi’s fire so far.  But soon its wood would run out, and the flames would be reduced to embers.  A few hours ago, Vikukshi and Nimi had set out towards the southern gate with a section of Suryavanshi warriors, trying to form a clear path through which soldiers and supplies could pass through.  Father was doing the same towards the western gate, while Haryashva commanded the wall.  Ambushed by Dasas, only the brothers remained in their party.       

	Nimi watched his brother fight with admiration, and a sibling envy he did not know he possessed.  Whatever legends he had heard about his father in battle, he saw them alive in Vikukshi.  The way his brother handled the sword and commanded men made him wonder why he had been content to be a milkman all this while.  He hid embarrassed when the enemy had charged, and pierced it with his blade from the back, while it was engaged with his brother.  “Let’s move ahead,” he said, trying to sound brave and determined like Vikukshi.

	“What for?”  Vikukshi countered.  “Even if we make it to the south gate, there is no way the two of us can clear it and secure the entire path.”  Vikukshi did not need to add that essentially it was him alone, for Nimi was no warrior.  

	“So what do we do then, turn back?”  Just as Nimi asked that, they heard the wailing of an infant from a nearby dwelling.  Vikukshi tensed and went into a crouch, while Nimi stared in the direction of the sound.  The child’s crying was muffled briefly before it erupted again, this time pierced with the clear shouts of a distressed mother.  The brothers rushed into the dwelling, and found two Dasas accosting a woman and her infant son.  Vikukshi charged at the one holding his sword up and Nimi, finding a rare moment of courage, charged headlong towards the second Dasa with his sword pointing outstretched.  His brazenness caused the Dasa to back up in alarm as the mother snatched her child back from his clutches.  Nimi lost conscious control of his limbs, and continued to rush towards the Dasa.  It was when the foreign tribal found the wall press in behind him that he thought to pull out his sword, but it was already too late.  Both he and Nimi cried out in alarm as Nimi’s sword went clean through his belly and bent when it hit the wall behind.  Nimi’s instinct was to let go of the sword, but Vikukshi’s voice spoke in his head,If you do find your sword inside a Dasa, remember to drag it as far up as you can, slicing his organs and tissues alike.  Grimacing, Nimi did as his brother had taught him, drenching himself in spatters of blood and gristle. 

	No sooner did he turn around that the mother fell at his feet.  “I thank you, Prince Nimi.  You have saved my child’s life.”

	His heart was pounding hard, and he heard the mother’s voice as if from afar.  “Please,” he heard himself say as he brought the woman up, his ears ringing, “Are you all right?”  The woman managed to nod.  Beside them, Vikukshi yanked his sword out of the slain Dasa and examined the infant. 

	“The baby seems to be okay,” he said.  “You must come with us, we will take you to safety.”

	The woman had elapsed into shock, and barely managed to nod.  Nimi picked up the infant in one arm and cradled it while he led the mother out with the other.  Vikukshi stepped out ahead of them, taking a sword in each arm.  Listening for any sudden sounds, they warily walked the mother and child towards the northern wall. 

	“You really did save the child’s life,” Vikukshi commented as they crept ahead.

	“You, not me,” Nimi countered. 

	“Not really, I charged at the other Dasa.  From then on it was irrelevant what I did, for the second Dasa would have harmed the child or the mother, or both, by then.  It was you who went for the relevant Dasa.”

	Nimi did not reply to that, the vision of his killing still playing out inside his head. 

	He did not see Vikukshi’s teasing smile, but from a distance he heard his brother say, “Great warriors acquire great titles in battle.  Our father was titled Ashvatrasa, The Horse Rider who Torments.  After today, I think I shall title you Janaka- the Protecting Patron.”

***

The north wall was not the secure garrison it was when they left.  They found the stairs crawling with fighting pairs of Suryavanshi and Dasas.  The Suryavedi had been left undefended, but its woods still burnt feebly and the fire was alive.  Apparently, the Dasas did not know of its significance, for any military mind would have extinguished it long ago to demoralize his enemy.  Vikukshi led them up a staircase that was inside the wall, and even Nimi did not know about its existence.  As soon as they emerged out to the platform at the top, they were attacked by Dasas.  There were other soldiers around to help this time, but Vikukshi nevertheless chucked Nimi’s sword back to him.  “Use it well, Janaka!”  His brother shouted above the clamour.

	Nimi ushered the mother back into the stairwell and handed her child back to her.  He stood guard there, occasionally stabbing and slashing the Dasas that came within his reach, while they fought other, more competent warriors.  After what seemed like hours of defending, he heard the unmistakable roar of King Ikshvaku.  He turned towards the source to see his father, standing tall and imposing.  The King, it seemed, had successfully cleared a path to the western wall.  Even the Dasas hesitated and made to retreat, but then Ikshvaku’s war cry was answered by another, more guttural and menacing in its tone.  Half his body inside the stairwell, Nimi turned the other way to find Narantaka, standing tall and formidable himself.  Unbidden, warriors from either side cleared the path between them, and Vikukshi joined the ranks behind his father.  Nimi urged the woman back down the stairwell and closed the hatch behind her before he joined his brother.

	“Before I end you, Rakshasa,” Ikshvaku said, pronouncing the name as a curse, “Tell me why.  Why do we stand here such, facing each other like enemies?”

	Narantaka snarled with menace and venom.  “How does it feel?”  He asked.  “How does it feel, having your home invaded by people who have no business there?”

	“Is that what this is about, a conflict close to thirty years old?”

	“This is about revenge,” Narantaka replied.  “You killed my woman and my children, or your men did- it is the same to me.  The very aim of my existence since then has been to avenge it.  Your gods are the Daevas.  Agni, Hurya and Haoma are objects of your worship.  I will pray to them today, so that your people may understand my curse.  I curse you, King Ikshvaku of the Suryavansha.  I curse you that forever the Suryavansha Kings will ache for their loved ones, and Rakshasas and Dasas will be the cause of it.  May this continue through generations, till the end of your line.  Now, come, meet me in battle.  Let only one of us remain standing alive today.”

	With that declaration he charged, exactly the way a Suryavanshi would have charged- his sword jutting out from the cleave in his shield, and the shield held firmly ahead of him to use as a battering ram.  Nimi remembered with a flash that Narantaka had trained with Suryavanshi soldiers for many years, and that was when his father charged back.  The two met at the center in a clash of wood and metal, splinters exploding out in crunching, grinding sounds.  Their movements were a blur, such was the speed of their swords.  He only heard the angry whooshes of blade against wind, or the grunting sounds of shields ramming against bones and each other.  Still they were a contrast, Narantaka and Ikshvaku.  The Dasa was a blur of hair and tattered leatherskins, his sword almost black in its colour.  Ikshvaku’s tanned skin gleamed under the yellow robeskins and shiny, metal armour.  For the longest time they were at a stalemate, their swords never managing to touch each other.  Then, cut by cut, Ikshvaku began gaining the upper hand.  Narantaka’s swings became slower and heavy, and he took longer to recover from them.  Ikshvaku wasted no time toying with his enemy, when he saw the opening, he leapt up with surprising agility and brought his sword down powerfully through Narantaka’s left shoulder, pushing it all the way down through the Rakshasa’s heart by his force.  They heard cries and groans among the Dasa warriors gathered, and many dropped their arms by the time Narantaka hit the ground.

 Just as Ikshvaku pulled away from him, the Rakshasa found a last spurt of strength and yanked a curved dagger out of his leatherskins.  Nimi cried out in warning, as did many around him, but Ikshvaku was slow to react.  Even as the King turned around and began walking away, Narantaka sprang up and brought his dagger arm around his neck.  Ikshvaku’s eyes widened in alarm, but before he could react, the curved dagger sliced clean across his neck, and at the bottom of his vision the King saw his own blood gush out.  He heard men shouting around him, and many charged to their King.  But before anyone got closer, the same silver knife pierced through his chest and cut into his heart.  He felt excruciation erupt from his heart and shoot to the ends of his limbs, then his consciousness gave out.  No one noticed, but around the same time the last flame of the Suryavedi wisped into non-existence.
