“Easy,” Dilipa whispered from behind.  Sudasa forced every muscle to remain absolutely still, taking his breath in calm, measured sets.  He was trained for this, he was prepared for this very moment.  It was a final step in his training, and he could not claim it to be over if did not complete this journey through the forest.  He stared back at the tiger, royal human eyes glinting back at the cold feline.  The tiger sniffed at him from afar, taking in his regal bearing and armed demeanor.  It had encountered such boys before, and had come out worse in a scuffle many years ago.  It had no desire to repeat the experience.  It snarled, as if to say ‘never mind’, and retreated into the foliage.  Sudasa let out no relieved exhale- his breathing had lost none of its controlled rhythm.  He turned around to face Dilipa and gave him a wide, cocky grin.

	“You got lucky,” Dilipa commented dryly.  “That one has encountered an Aikshvaku acolyte before, and remembers it too.”

	Sudasa knew that was true, for he too had noticed the unmistakable scar of a sword slashed across the tiger’s face.  But even that gave him a healthy confidence.  If an Aikshvaku trainee could do that to a tiger, then he too would be a worthy match.  Five years of rigorous training under the Suryavansha had seen to that.  Dilipa continued to follow Sudasa deeper into the forest.  As Ayodhya’s crown prince, he was Sudasa’s official protector- charged with the responsibility of ensuring that nothing untoward happened to the Bharata crown prince.  But Sudasa knew from experience that Dilipa would intervene only in the direst of circumstances.

	They found a clearing at night and set camp, casting the time-tested Suryavanshi perimeter of fire-torches to guard against curious predators.  Two more nights of journey separated them from their destination- Govanda, royal cattle farms of the Suryavansha.  Mukhyapati Yuyudha would be awaiting Sudasa there, ready to confer his final verdict on the pupil, tempered by assessments submitted by Dilipa and Rshi Vasishtha.  The forest around Ayodhya and Govanda was cleared of all Rakshasa and Yaksha settlements, primarily due to the efforts of Dilipa’s ancestors- Ayudha, Kosala and Mitrasaha.  There was even a shorter goat path that led to Govanda, but the princes had taken a longer, forest path that took them north-east of Ayodhya before turning direction towards Govanda.  They talked, sang and drank on wine that night- their company more of old friends than ward and guardian.  They parried hymns from the Veda, competing to dedicate poems to the Devas one by one.  Then the prayers turned to the Pitras, their respective ancestors- the solemn and mythic figures of Ikshvaku, Prithu, Mandhatra, Bahu, Bharata, Suhotra, Ajamidha, Vena, Tritsu and more.      

	The sun was beginning to announce its return to the sky with a pale, dawn-orange glow when Dilipa said to Sudasa, “Tell me more of Bharata, your First King and Founder.  Was he truly a son of Dushyanta?  And if he was, then why not take the name of Puru?”

	Memories of lessons delivered by Rshi Vasishtha returned to Sudasa.  Each learning received at the banks of the Confluence was etched clearly in his mind.  “Blood and lineage is everything, is it not?”  Sudasa asked, though it was more a thought said aloud than a query.  “King Dushyanta publicly and proudly proclaimed young Sarvadamana as his son, and titled him Bharata.  He did so in the presence of his closest advisors- all men of Puru blood, owing loyalty to his line.  Within days after his death, those very men disowned Bharata and denied his claim of Puru blood.  Yet when generations later a man with grey eyes marched into Plaksha, the Purus welcomed him as one of their own.  Why would the line of Bharata want to ally itself with such lot?”

	“The grey eyes have indeed never occurred in the line of Bharata,” Dilipa pointed out.

	Sudasa smiled without humour.  “Two things about that,” he said.  “One, First King Bharata took after his mother, and he passed on very little of his father’s blood to his children.  Second, the reputation of eye colour as an indicator of tribal ancestry is grossly overrated and misplaced.  There were hundreds of the Solar that migrated with Marici, and waves of hundred after.  Do you claim that each of them had the famed orange eyes of Surya, or that every Suryavanshi King did?”

	On that Dilipa was silent.  The records often sang of men like Prithu, Ardra and Harita as Kings with brown, common eyes.  “In any case,” Sudasa continued, “Their shared physical traits did not stop the Puru from in-fighting after Dushyanta’s death.”

	“And Bharata, son of Dushyanta, stepped in to grasp the reins of Aryavarta,” added Dilipa.  “I am fascinated by this man, Sudasa.  Tell me his stories, tell me of the man he was.”

	Sudasa pondered at that request.  There was so much to his ancient ancestor, so many myths and fables woven around his personage.  “I will tell you a few tales, my guardian and friend,” Sudasa said.  “Some are of the times preceding First King Bharata’s famed Ashvamedha, and some are of the times when he stepped down and gave the Kingdom to his sons.  And then I will have to tell you so much more, for the history of our First King is but the history of his greatest gifts to Aryavarta- Prayaga and Kashi.  We will have to space it out, however- we do have two more nights of travel left, and morning is almost upon us.”

**Year 503, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

“No,” corrected Bharata.  “The eastern Suryavansha Kingdom has its capital at Sravasti, ruled by Brhadashva, the grandson of its founder- Sravasta.  Sravasta in turn was the brother of Mandhatra, who waged war against our Puru forefathers.”

	But am I truly Puru?  Bharata wondered for yet another time in his forty-nine year old life. As a child he once posed it to his father.  Am I adopted, or am I your true son, father?  Dushyanta had stared at him long and hard before simply replying, You are my son, that’s all that matters.  That ambiguity around his parentage allowed the old Somavansha-Puru families to rally support against him and deny him the throne after Dushyanta’s death.  Bharata was not born in Aryavarta, he did not have Dushyanta’s grey eyes and he had appeared only at the age of twelve, right when Dushyanta forged a new Puru Kingdom.  The moonstone ring on his finger did not matter to those who later cast doubt on his ancestry.

	“Tell us about the western Suryavansha, father,” urged Suhotra, his elder son.  At the young age of seventeen, Suhotra already looked like a man.  Like his brother and father, he had none of the traits that characterized Puru blood for generations, nor the traits of the Somavanshi before Puru’s time.

	“Their seat is the ancient city of Avisari, founded by their first King- Ikshvaku,” narrated Bharata. “The western Suryavanshi are ruled by King Trsadasa, who has acquired that title by waging war against the Dasas for two decades.”

	“The Suryavansha is a united clan,” Suhotra said, “But why do the Somavanshi and Puru fight among themselves?”  It was a fair question.  The eastern and western Suryavanshi were kindred Kingdoms, ruled by cousins who sought no power from or over the other.  On the other hand, the Puru-Somavanshi had nearly killed themselves to extinction. 

	Bharata wanted to tell his sons that it was no more than what the Purus deserved, and they sensed his thoughts.  “We will unite the Puru Kingdoms again,” Suhotra said confidently.  Bharata had to smile at that, his sons’ determination was a signal of great things to come.  But it would not be in the name of the Puru or the Somavanshi, Bharata would not use those ties to forge the Kingdom his father dreamt of.  

***

 “Suryavanshi patrols scout the region,” the scout reported.  “It would be impossible to get a group so large through without being noticed.”

	Bharata grunted in frustration.  There was no love lost between the Suryavansha and the Purus, and even though Bharata’s own had disowned him, the Suryavanshi King Trsadasa still considered him the legal heir of Dushyanta Puru.  Bharata had spent five years in the harsh and mountainous north, hiding among the remote villages between Sringara, Loha and Skardu.  Now he was determined to return and claim the lands that were rightfully his.  But first he and his men had to cross the Asikni River, and the only crossing- Navapari, was a Suryavanshi fortress built upon the river.  For yojanas around Navapari, the land was swarming with Suryavanshi patrols.  

	“How many men?”  He asked, wondering if his force could take them on.  

	“Each patrol has at least ten men,” the scout replied, “And no more than twenty.  I counted at least seven different patrols.”

	“Assuming it is double that,” Bharata said, “We are facing less than three hundred men.  Surely we can take them on.”  

But beneath his bluster, Bharata knew that was not true.  His force of less than a thousand men had not seen true battle for seven years now.  They had no knowledge of war-craft, an art the Suryavansha had perfected.  Even two hundred Suryavanshi soldiers would considerably dent Bharata’s meagre force.  He knew he could get more men, many warriors would return to the banner of Dushyanta’s son.  But those men were in Plaksha, Haradvara, Ahikshetra and Pratisthana.  And Bharata would have to get through Suryavanshi land first. 

	Yamini broke into his thoughts and confirmed his misgivings.  “The risk is too large,” she said.  Bharata had released Yamini from her duties after the death of her father and his chief lieutenant- Dvivedi, nearly a decade ago.  But she inherited her father’s loyalty to his banner, and proved herself to be his most able successor.  She continued, “A single warrior could ride back to either of the Suryavansha Kingdoms and reveal our presence.”

	“But we must reach Makarandi,” Bharata insisted, speaking of the ancient, deserted river crossing town by the Ganga.  “Where else can I build my Kingdom, and how?”

	“It does not matter where you build the Kingdom,” Yamini offered.  “What matters is the manner in which you build it.”  There was shrewd smirk upon her face, easily indicating that she possessed knowledge that her chief did not.

	“What are you talking about?”  Bharata said, as comfortable with his lieutenant’s informality as ever.

	“Patience, my soon-to-be-King.  I will show you when it’s ready.”

The vehicle was unlike anything he had ever seen.  Two enormous wheels supported it from either side with a grand seat in the middle, ornate and layered with gold.  Below the main seat was another smaller one, less opulent.  The seats in turn were yoked to two beautiful, black stallions.  The stallions had clearly been freshly scrubbed and bathed.  Their coats gleamed as mighty as the gold and metal yoked to them.  An awning covered the seats, domed with intricate carvings and figurines.  Bharata made out subtle Puru and Somavanshi insignia among the figurines.  But he could not blame the artist for that- he had not developed any symbols of his new banner.

	“What is this?”  Bharata asked, awed.

	“A chariot,” Yamini replied, pleased.  “This will be the symbol of your ascension, the new instrument of war.  Using it, you will be able to fight in all four directions while I steer.”

	“How many can we make?”  He asked, still consuming the vision of this battle machine in front of him.  But his mind was already running calculations, visualizing a field full of these behemoths.

	“As many as you wish,” she replied.  “The chariot is made from wood gathered from the forest around us, and we have enough of the gold King Dushyanta claimed from Madra and Trigarta.”

	Wheels turned in Bharata’s head, plans upon plans formed.  “Bring me the map,” he commanded.  Two aides stepped forward and placed the large, clay-tablet map in front of Bharata and Yamini.  It was an old map, descended to Bharata from his mother’s line- created by the ancient sculpting guilds of King Nahusha.  

	“Here,” he said, pointing his finger to a location on the map, “This is where we are, roughly.”

	“Aye,” Yamini agreed.

	“If we head east we will run into the Suryavanshi at some point, and to the west lies the Ganga and rogue Puru bands.  We cannot make it to Makarandi without these chariots.  But constructing an army of chariots will take time and space, neither of which we can afford.”

	Just then the ground beneath them shook violently, throwing them off their feet.  As Bharata hit the ground the surface shook again, angrier this time.  Bharata’s thoughts went to his wife and sons, camped some way down the line.  Beside him their temporary dwellings collapsed in a storm of dust and gravel, and he heard the surprised shouts of disoriented men.  The ground continued to shake, getting severe each passing moment.  He heard men call out prayers to the Devas, begging them to save them from the pralaya that had erupted around them.  Before long, Bharata found that he was praying too, but the ground continued to shake for what seemed like an eternity.

“It is indeed as you suspected, Rshi Vasishtha,” Bharata said.  “The earthquake was widespread and destructive.  The cities of Harayupa, Vitabhya and Vinasana have sustained severe damage; and countless towns along the Sarasvati are utterly destroyed.  Up north, the Suryavansha Kingdom is in disarray.  King Trsadasa was buried beneath his own palace and Avisari is in ruins.”

	Maitravaruni Vasishtha nodded gravely, his thoughts going to the rshi of his name who would have been Trsadasa’s Rajpurohit.  That Vasishtha could quite possibly have been a descendant of the original Maharshi, but Maitravaruni was only a student of the school.  Yet it had been enough for Bharata to anoint him his family rshi.  “The reverberations reached as far east as Sravasti and Videha,” Vasishtha added from reports he received.  “The Janakas’ mountain city has developed cracks, and will have to be rebuilt.”

	“Have we truly offended the Devas, Rshi?”  Bharata asked. “To make the earth itself vibrate in anger, destroying everything that sleeps upon it, what did we do to anger Them such?”

	Vasishtha measured his words before responding.  “The Devas preside over forces of nature, but they do not control them.  Nature is not and never has been a mistress to them.  Even from the times when the Devas are said to have walked the earth, there are legends of great floods and earthquakes.”

	“But of what use is it to be a patron, if one cannot prevent such catastrophes?”

	“That would override the random will of Nature, violating the independent machinations of Rta- the Cosmic Order,” Vasishtha replied sagely.  “The Devas preside over elements not to control and yield them, but for our benefit.  How else can we communicate with Rta, how else can we hope to find unity with it?  We need mediums between us and that complex, parahuman phenomenon.  That is where the Devas step in.”

	“Then is there nothing more supreme than the Cosmic Order?”  Bharata asked.

	“There is only one thing that overrides the Cosmic Order,” Vasishtha said.  “It is the fundamental free will of the sentient being.  You, Bharata, can override Rta.  You can choose to continue seeking your objectives, even if the very earth may shake.  All that happens is actually in your hands, in your will.  If you choose now to give up and forsake the aspirations you once held, then it is only you who has defeated Bharata.”

	“But the earth may have crushed me and put me to death,” Bharata countered.  “What would my will matter then?”

	“Death is not the end of life,” Vasishtha replied, as simply as he may have made a more mundane statement.  “Death is an opportunity to pursue the dreams which we held in the other worlds, the worlds where we are asleep while we wander awake here.”  

***

“This is essentially how Ikshvaku did it as well,” reasoned Yamini, agreeing with Rshi Vasishtha for once.  

	“She’s right,” Vasishtha confirmed.  “His forces strengthened with Ashvaka horses, Ikshvaku did indeed send stallions to all four corners.  But it was not so symbolic then- more a necessity brought on by unfamiliar terrain and vast, unending stretches of land.”

	Bharata frowned, unable to accept the proposal so easily.  He had hoped to make it across the Yamuna and crown himself King between the river and the Ganga.  Part of the urgency to cross the Yamuna was because of the scattered Suryavanshi, who were once again migrating out of their lands en masse.  He would have found a way to deal with that, as he had with every obstacle that was thrown at him in the past nine years.  But then he was handed with the most crippling information of them all.  Suryavanshi armies were spotted all across the land west of the Yamuna, making their moves on chariots!  Bharata had probed the matter furiously to find that the Suryavanshi had taken their chariot designs from the Shakas, that western tribe far outside the borders of Aryavarta.  Bharata’s one crowning instrument had been rendered useless both symbolically and strategically.  And now Rshi Vasishtha had come up with this proposal.

	“Explain it to me again,” Bharata said, hoping he would find the merits this time.

	“I have named it Ashvamedha, the Horse Sacrifice,” Vasishtha said proudly, “and the idea is simple.  We will choose a black stallion, anoint it with the symbols of your dynasty and set it free to roam the land.  Your forces will follow this horse from a distance, and wherever the steed goes they will claim as your territory.  Those who oppose will have to fight your men, and those who agree will be assimilated into your Kingdom.  That is as simply as I can put it.”

	“And for how long will this horse be allowed to roam?”  Bharata asked.

	“Half a year,” Vasishtha replied.  “From the vernal to the autumnal equinox.”

	“What if the horse turns back, what if it injures itself or moves too slow?”

	“The horse can be,” Yamini said, and then paused to find the word.  “Gently guided,” she said finally.  Bharata turned to Vasishtha, who concurred by his silence.

	“And you think this will be a sufficiently strong symbol, Rshi Vasishtha?”  Bharat asked.  

	“Under the circumstances, yes,” Vasishtha replied confidently.  “Trsadasa and the western Suryavanshi are a Kingdom no more, the Druhyus are still recovering from floods and the earthquake, the eastern Suryavanshi are beyond the forest and the Anavas even further.  It is only the Yadavas we have to contend with at the moment, and even they are weakened since the earthquake.  There is no better time to claim territory and establish a large Kingdom.”

	Bharata looked from Vasishtha to Yamini, who was nodding her head vigorously.  He took his time before replying, “Very well, we will have this Ashvamedha.”

***

What was intended as a ritual had become a grand festival.  Dwellings and fortifications were erected within days, wells dug up and banner-posts stuck into the ground.  Almost overnight, the people founded a new town and named it Bharatpura in honour of their soon-to-be-crowned King.  The entire town was littered with Vedis, the ritual fires of Agni billowing soot and smoke.  Bharata didn’t mind it, he enjoyed the teary, burning sensation that came to the eyes from being close to ritual fires.  Vasishtha sat even closer to the Mahavedi, impervious to the very element he was praying to.  The stallion selected was a strong, magnificent creature.  It’s pure, black hide was in stark contrast to the ornamentation it had been burdened with.  Gold bangles hung around its legs and an intricate gold chain ran over its head.  The chain fell down to the nose and closed round the mouth. 

	When it had come to anointing the horse with the royal insignia, Bharata prevented the painter from colouring the symbols of Somavansha and Puru.  Those were the lines that rejected him and drove him out of what he always considered home.  “From this day on,” he said to the excited denizens of Bharatpura, “I shall no longer strive for the power of Soma and Puru.  We are a new people now, forging a new destiny- we are the Bharatas!”  The roar that erupted after that sent birds fleeing for miles around.

	Given Maitravaruni Vasishtha’s schooling, it was inevitable that the Ashvamedha’s physical layout was heavily borrowed from Suryavanshi designs.  There were five Vedis, together forming the shape of an arrow.  In the front was the Uttaravedi, and Vasishtha set his son to conduct affairs there.  At either sides of the arrow’s tip, Vasishtha constructed massive Vedis dedicated to Varuna- his patron deity.  “We want our expansion to be swift and fluid,” he explained.  “Just like water, rivers and streams.  It is Varuna who presides over this liquid force.”

	At the center of the tip, where the shaft began, was the Mahavedi- presided by Vasishtha and attended by Bharata and his family.  The Ashvamedha stallion was yoked here, as well as numerous lesser horses and sheep intended for sacrifice.  At the other end of the shaft was what Vasishtha named the Bharatvedi- a naked, raw flame that was surrounded by the first contingent of Bharata’s army.  This contingent would lead the Ashvamedha army behind the horse.  Each of the five Vedis were placed upon brick altars constructed to Vasishtha’s strict measurements.  

	The flames of the Mahavedi were the last and most difficult to light, but once done they blazed taller than any of the others.  Vasishtha walked up to the stallion and beckoned Bharata closer.

	“We will keep chanting mantras from the Veda for half a year,” Vasishtha said, his eyes red from soot.  “But this horse will hear only one mantra, here today, before we send it off.”

	“Your knowledge of the Veda is infinitely more than mine, Rshi Vasishtha,” Bharata submitted.  “I trust you to choose the propitious mantra.”

	“For this occasion I have composed a new one, and after this day I will find a way to code it within the Veda’s existing structure.”  There was no pride in Vasishtha’s voice, no tone of ownership.

	“This Ashvamedha is blessed then, Rshi,” Bharata said.

	“I call it the Nadistuti Sukta,” Vasishtha said.  “Its purpose is to introduce this beast to the geography and rivers of Aryavarta.”  Vasishtha bent closer to the horse and began, his pronunciation perfect and intonation deep.  

The Singer, O ye Waters in Vivasvana’s place, shall tell your grandeur forth that is beyond compare.  The Rivers have come forward triply, seven and seven.  Sindhu in might surpasses all the streams that flow.  

Varuṇa cut the channels for thy forward course, O Sindhu, when thou runnest on to win the race.  Thou speedest o’er precipitous ridges of the earth, when thou art Lord and Leader of these moving floods.

His roar is lifted up to heaven above the earth: he puts forth endless vigour with a flash of light.  Like floods of rain that fall in thunder from the cloud, so Sindhu rushes on bellowing like a bull.

Like mothers to their calves, like milchkine with their milk, so, Sindhu, unto thee the roaring rivers run. \
Thou leadest as a warrior king thine army's wings what time thou comest in the van of these swift streams.

Favour ye this my laud, O Ganga, Yamuna, O Shatadru, Iravati and Sarasvati. \
With Asikni, Vitasta, O Marudvrdha, O Arjikiya with Susoma hear my call.

First with Trstama thou art eager to flow forth, with Rasa, and Susartu, and with Svetya here. \
With Kubha; and with these, Sindhu and Mehatnu, thou seekest in thy course Krumu and Gomati.

Flashing and whitely-gleaming in her mightiness, she moves along her ample volumes through the realms.  Most active of the active, Sindhu unrestrained, like to a dappled mare, beautiful, fair to see.

Rich in good steeds is Sindhu, rich in cars and robes, rich in gold, nobly-fashioned, rich in ample wealth. \
Blest Silamavati and young Urnavati invest themselves with raiment rich in store of sweets.

Sindhu hath yoked her car, light-rolling, drawn by steeds, and with that car shall she win booty in this fight.  So have I praised its power, mighty and unrestrained, of independent glory, roaring as it runs.

Vasishtha concluded the Sukta with a deep and loud “Aum” that was picked up by rshis across all the Vedis and soon became a booming hum.  With that, the Ashvamedha was underway.
