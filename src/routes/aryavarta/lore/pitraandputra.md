>Avisari, Rajavasa, Vinasana and Pratisthana- these were the great cities of ancient Aryavarta.  Not even Sivobheda or Videha ever matched their glory.  But the grandest of old Aryavarta cities were eclipsed by the Bharata capitals- Kashi and Prayaga.  Their wealth, power, and stability forever changed Aryavarta.<br><cite>From The Collective Wisdom of the Janakas, discovered by Bharata scouts after the War of Ten Kings</cite>

Prayaga was in grand celebration.  King Pijavana had returned victorious from his campaign against the Yadavas, Mathura and Ekachakra belonging to the Bharatas now.  Sudasa joined the festivities with as much elation as anyone else, but he did not truly feel joy within himself.  Hundreds of Bharata soldiers had lost their lives in the campaign, what right did he have to sing and dance while their families grieved in their homes?

	Pijavana was in a weary state, but he did bathe and clean himself to look like the King when he presented himself to his subjects.  The father was of the same sentiment as his son.  “We do have reason to celebrate today,” he said, “But let us not forget that this victory comes at the cost of six hundred and thirty two men.  Hundreds more have returned with irreparable scars and amputations.  Their families are not the ones celebrating today, they are mourning their dead and cursing the horrible war we raise our songs to.  Let that serve as a reminder that war is never desirable, and it only perpetrates further war.  One day, the Yadavas will return to claim their cities, and more Bharata sons will die to defend them.”

	The King paused, realising that he had dampened the celebrations with his grim talk.  He sighed and smiled benignly.  “But that is our curse is it not?”  He said, spreading his arms wide.  “The Bharatas have always had to stamp their authority in Aryavarta with death and force, power and fear!”

	“If the Yadavas return, we will whip them all the way back to Ujjayani!”  Shouted one enthusiastic urchin.  His voice had not cracked yet, and the squeaky enthusiasm brought laughter even to the King.  The festive air restored, Pijavana retreated into the privacy of his quarters, his son with him.  

	“The decision to attack Mathura was not mine, much less that to attack Ekachakra,” the King said to his son when they were alone.  “Our actions will only bring further reaction from the Yadavas.”

	Sudasa nodded.  “But what choice did we have, father?  We had to send a message to the Yadavas.”

	“And what message is that?”  Pijavana asked sharply.  “That the Bharatas are an enemy not to be taken lightly?  That gives them all more reason to unite and pit their attention on us.  Puru, Yadava, Anava, Druhyu and Turvasu- these five allied tribes predate the Bharata by several centuries.  How is our claim on this land any more righteous than theirs?  Yamaprastha once belonged to the Purus- it should rather be Yadava territory than ours!”

	“Then what would you have us do, father?”  Sudasa asked, unable to follow his father’s line of argument.

	Pijavana sighed.  “I do not really know, son.  Who really has right over Aryavarta?  Does one tribe truly have singular right anyway?  Why can we not share this great land?  We often forget that First King Bharata was the son of Dushyanta- a Puru King.  We are in fact related to those who we call enemies.  Did our greatest Kings and Maharshis truly wish that upon Aryavarta?”

**Year 465, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

“Pratisthana was once Aryavarta’s greatest city,” said Mahamana, smiling at the young Sarva’s eager face, “More glorious than even Rajavasa, Vitabhya or Avisari.  It gave the Suryavansha a fight like the tribe had never seen.  But eventually it fell, like all cities under relentless siege do.”

	“And now there is no city in Aryavarta to match the glory of Gandhara,” Sarvadamana finished, wanting to show his knowledge off to the burly Gandharan soldier.

	Mahamana nodded in agreement.  “Well said, young Sarva.  Gandhara is now the greatest city on either side of the Sindhu.  It is said that east of the Sindhu is a land of wild tribes and savages, with no true Kings and warriors left.”

	Mahamana finished patting the horse down and hoisted his saddle, keeping his movements deliberate for Sarvadamana’s benefit.  The young boy’s zeal for horse riding was endearing, and Mahamana was not the only soldier who humoured his company in his free time.  “Where did you say you’re from, again?”  Mahamana asked.  He could never remember the remote cities and rivers Sarva talked about.

	“I was born in Dasarna on the banks of the Sindhu, but I am actually from the lands of Ganga and Yamuna,” Sarvadamana repeated his well-rehearsed line.  “Once, my ancestors ruled from Pratisthana to Avisari.”

	Mahamana chuckled and realized why he always forgot Sarva’s origins.  The young stable boy’s stories were so far-fetched that their memory could not last for more than a night of drinking.  “Do you invent these stories on your own, or does your mother feed them to you?”

	Sarvadamana opened his mouth to say something, but then hesitated.  After a while he said, “My mother has said this to me, but they are true.”

	“I’m sure they are,” said Mahamana in good humour.  He ruffled Sarva’s hair, as most soldiers annoyingly did, and walked away after handing him a morsel of bread.  

Gandhara, rising city of the new world.  In the years since the Suryavanshi had migrated away under Mandhatra, sparse news and trade flowed in from the east.  Gandhara’s only contact with Aryavarta came from the coastal cities of Maichala and Dvaravati, and this made it the nexus of trade between Aryavarta and the world west of it.  Metal still came from the mining towns of Trigarta and Madra, but at exorbitant prices, and extremely rarely.  Instead, trade was dominated by ivory, clayware and beaded jewellery.  Of Kings and rulers, even less was known.  The Suryavanshi Kings that defeated and wiped out the Puru were no more, or were not heard of.  The only tribes that commanded any power in Aryavarta were the Yadavas and Anavas, but they were so far away from Gandhara and its politics that Sarvadamana heard nothing of them in the stables and kitchens.  

He cleaned up after the horses once Mahamana left, and wiped the stable with fresh rags.  The sky was already the pale shade of evening-orange by the time he was done.  Sarvadamana picked up a wooden sword and practiced his own model of sword-play, untrained as he was.  He swiped and parried at imaginary opponents till the sun was down and night torches glittered Gandhara’s skyline.  Then he made his way home, with the piece of bread Mahamana had handed him safely tucked in his dry pouch.  

Shakuntala was waiting anxiously at the front yard for her son to arrive.  He was only nine, but Sarvadamana often conducted himself as a much older boy.  He was known to wander off fearlessly into Gandhara’s crowded alleys, making conversation with strangers and soldiers alike, and even stealing the odd fruits and bread from the marketplace.     

Her son’s walked towards her with his expression downcast.  “Only a single piece of bread today, mother,” he said.

Shakuntala smiled benignly and spread her arms out, bending her knees to bring herself to Sarvadamana’s height.  After being out all day, he was dusty and dirty all over, his hair ruffled and muddy.  She wiped his locks off his face and said, “That’s okay my son, I managed to bring some fruits for you today.”

	On any other day, this would have brought a smile to Sarvadamana’s face.  But on this day the bright, gleaming fruits failed to lighten his mood.  He made up a smile, thinking it to be good enough to convince his mother, and dutifully picked up an apple, smiling as he ate it.  The act did not fool Shakuntala, who was used to her son returning in somber moods.  Usually, it was because someone had said something to remind Sarvadamana’s of his uncertain ancestry. 

	Shakuntala had always known that one day her son would return to Aryavarta, the land of his forefathers.  In her heart, as she watched her son eat the fruits she had procured, she decided that she would take him there herself.  She would find his father for him, and let her son look at the man who had given him life.

“It cannot be done without,” contended Marutt.  A tall, burly Dasa from beyond the Sindhu, he understood little of Aryavarta’s geography or history.  

	“And yet it must, my friend,” replied Dushyanta calmly.  “Trigarta and Madra are independent towns, respected as such.  No tribe, no king has ever attacked them.  And I will not be the first to do so.” 

	“Then you will send your men to battle without armour and weapons,” Marutt said simply, a dismissive sneer on his face.  “I am honour bound to help you, Dushyanta, and me and my men will be with you all the way.  But refusing to attack Trigarta and Madra will be seen as a weakness by my soldiers.  Besides, those are the only places where they can hope to gain some personal loot for their troubles.  You will deny them that?”

	Dushyanta sighed, wondering for yet another time whether it had been a mistake to ask for his friend’s aid.  Marutt and his band of Dasas from the far west were on completely unfamiliar territory.  They understood none of the local political dynamics, and saw direct, brutal war as the only resolution to any conflict.  It was right in some ways, but Dushyanta knew that attacking Trigarta and Madra would rob him of any legitimacy he hopes to claim.  There would be rebellion even within the ranks of men he had gathered over the years.  He had explained this several times to Marutt, but the Dasa leader scoffed at such ‘trivialities.’

	“If it is compensation that your men seek, then that can be arranged at Plaksha,” Dushyanta said.  “Every man will get more than his due, this I have promised you.”

	Marutt shook his head in the negative and moved closer to Dushyanta, lowering his voice to a husky growl.  “While you kings have built cities and dynasties, it is not your names that have carried out to the west through merchant caravans and trading boats.  None have heard of the Puru or Suryavansha, of Rajavasa or Pratisthana.  They have heard of the Trigarta though, and Madra too.  They have heard of giant wells dug into the ground, of fires raging day and night, even through rain and storm.  Of rock and ore being melted into liquid and sculpted into all forms of shapes and sizes.  Do you think these men would march right past those legendary towns, ignoring the fire they would smell in the air?”

	Marutt commanded a thousand men, nearly one-third of Dushyanta’s entire force.  Without his strength, Dushyanta would have little chance of conquering and holding Plaksha.  “Only Madra then,” he said finally, “And the citizens are not to be harmed.”

The geography of Aryavarta was laid out in Sarvadamana’s mind like a map.  He could visualize how they had taken a long diversion away from their final destination, sticking to the known, safe travelling routes.  In an earlier time, one could have cut into Aryavarta from Dasarna, circling north or south of the Kamyakvana.  But since the disappearance of the Suryavanshi, those were not lands that a mother and her ten-year old son should venture into, given as they were to savage bands of tribes wrung together by transitory allegiances.  Sarvadamana and his mother had taken the Sindhu downstream from Dasarna, all the way to where it met the ocean.  They sailed right through Vitabhya, once a golden city of the Suryavanshi and now a Dasa stronghold.  From the port town of Maichala, they took a boat to Dvaravati, a much larger port city further south.  At Dvaravati they found the first signs of civilisation.  There were organized marketplaces everywhere, and the sighting of sentries signalled the presence of rule.

	Shakuntala and Sarvadamana soon learnt that they were in Yadava country.  From Dvaravati, a short boat trip further into the bay took them to Vadodri, and a five day journey from there brought them to Ujjayani, capital of the Yadava Kingdom.  Despite the obvious differences in its colour and people, Sarvadamana thought that Ujjayani was none too different from Gandhara.  It was clear that the populace here was a protected, well-fed one.  Sarvadamana saw large bellies and fat arms, sights hitherto seen only in Gandhara’s crowded market alleys.      

	Sarvadamana wanted to scurry into the lanes, picking up the chatter of common-folk and soldiers alike.  But Shakuntala kept him close to her throughout the journey, inventing false names for them and not revealing much to anyone.  “Aryavarta is a dangerous land, my son,” she had warned him when they set out. “It is a place where history and dead men loom like a dark cloud over the living.  Your blood and birth matter a lot in where you will end up.  Keep our identities secret, and speak to no stranger.”

	And so Sarvadamana knew nothing of the lands he passed through, nor of the rulers and leaders that now commanded Aryavarta.  At Ekachakra, they heard the first rumblings of a new war up north, and they could get no caravan to take them to Makarandi, the river crossing village by the Ganga.  They were stuck at Ekachakra for months while slow news trickled in of a Puru resurgence in the north, spreading from Navapari to Plaksha.  Sarvadamana imagined the Puru warriors as tall, strong men, all related to him by blood- even if by a distant measure.  He wanted to be among them, tending to their horses till he was old enough to fight himself.  Most of all, he thought of his father- the figure he had never known or seen.  If everything his mother had told him was true, then Sarvadamana’s father would be one of the leaders of this Puru war force in the north, leading from the forefront of battle.  

	Shakuntala found work in Ekachakra’s marketplace as a sorter of trade ware, while Sarvadamana took up his usual routine as a stable-boy.  The months passed, and he entered his twelfth year, feeling a lot older and mature for his age.  He had a lean, starved look to him, but his own training and exercise regimen had sculpted his sparse muscles.  The other kids stayed away from Sarvadamana and he preferred it that way.  Resuming their journey to the north and finding his father was all he thought of now.  

	Finally, after many long months, reports came in that the Purus in the north had won, and that they would forge their ancient, powerful Kingdom anew.  Celebration was in the air at Ekachakra, the Purus and Yadavas were brethren tribes after all.  A generous trader offered them a ride to Makarandi for free, banking surely on a wave of revenue coming his way from new and old trade routes now made active.  Sarvadamana had grown up to stories of the Ganga and Yamuna, all vividly told by his mother.  He had nurtured the desire to set foot upon their banks ever since he could remember.  It was at Makarandi that he could feel that the dream was finally seeing reality.  The wind was different here, fresh and cool like the river it flew over.  Fertile grass and dense forest could be seen for miles around, a sight in direct contrast to the brown and grey around Gandhara.  And in the distance, one could even squint out a sight of the grand Himalayas.  

	Makarandi was where they heard of the new Puru King- Dushyanta.  At his name, Shakuntala’s eyes widened briefly, before the veneer of an unfamiliar traveller was back in them.  She seemed a lot more agitated after that, though Sarvadamana could not make out whether his mother was anxious to reach their destination, or afraid of actually doing so.  An arduous, week-long journey north along the Ganga brought them to the ashrama of Vrukasthali.  Here Sarvadamana set his sight on a rshi for the first time.  His young but trained eyes saw several differences in the ritual of the rshis of Vrukasthali to the fire-prayers of Dasa lands.  What struck him first was the absence of Soma, even as he made out intricate mantras dedicated to it.  In Vrukasthali, he was able to forget his destination for a while, losing himself to the many layers of knowledge hidden in the rituals of Aryavarta.  Even a lifetime did not seem enough to grasp all that knowledge these rshis possessed, their eyes glowing with a moist light that hinted that they had already discovered the secrets of the universe.  

	Shakuntala seemed as disinterested in the rshis as Sarvadamana was in awe of them.  He saw his mother look into their eyes directly, something others avoided doing.  She would speak in front of them without refrain, often interrupting them.  It got her glowering looks from the rshis and others alike, but Shakuntala was impervious or oblivious, Sarvadamana could not make out which.  He put this to her when they set off from Vrukasthali, asking, “Why do you not respect the rshis as the others do, mother?”

	“A rshi is no more or less than any other man, Sarva,” Shakuntala replied touchily.  

	That was not what the legends of Maharshis like Vasishtha and Atri would have Sarvadamana believe, and he decided to challenge his mother.  “How would you know?”  In his twelve-year old mind, Shakuntala had little of a life before the one they knew in Gandhara.  

	“I know because I have lived with one,” Shakuntala replied, a dejected tinge to her voice.  “I am the daughter of a rshi.  It was at an ashrama like this that your father found me, and I fell in love with him.”

***

The Puru leadership was encamped at a newly built village, situated at the north-west bank of the Ganga as it curved south on its journey.  Warriors were everywhere, walking tall and formidable to the eyes of twelve-year old Sarvadamana.  There were rshis here too, mingling freely with the soldiers as the village celebrated the return of a Puru King.  Sarvadamana wanted to lay his eyes on this King, Dushyanta.  Was his own father a cousin of Dushyanta, or a nephew maybe?  Never for a moment did Sarvadamana imagine that Dushyanta could be his father, but he did remember his mother’s wide-eyed look when the name of Dushyanta was first mentioned to them, months ago.  He let Shakuntala lead the way, and the more they had penetrated into the heartland of Aryavarta, the more his mother seemed familiar and confident of her surroundings.  The weary, timid woman of Gandhara was long gone now, replaced by the swagger of someone who felt supremely at home.  It still came to Sarvadamana as a surprise when he heard her introduce themselves by their real names, and declared her intention to meet the King. 

	The soldier and rshi who had questioned them looked at each other uncertainly, and Shakuntala repeated herself.  “I am Shakuntala, and this is my son, Sarvadamana.  I bear the symbol of the Puru dynasty with me, and I wish to deliver it to the King.”

	“Let them through,” called out a voice from behind the crowd.  The rshi and soldier instantly backed away, as did the line of men in front of them.  Through the gap Sarvadamana saw a large, muscular man mounted upon a horse, his flowing hair and beard completely white.  A look passed between his mother and this man, and Sarvadamana intuitively realized that they knew each other.  Shakuntala confidently led her son through the gap, her eyes searching for his father.

	It was the father that saw them first, his eyes locking at Shakuntala, and looking at her almost reverentially.  He walked towards them with deliberate steps, though he had not noticed Sarvadamana yet.  “You are here,” he whispered when he stood in front of her, looking at her with consummate love.  

	“When my Kingdom is won, then I will call for you,” Shakuntala said.  “This is what you once said to me.  And what did I reply, my lord?”

	Sarvadamana’s father smiled, still not noticing his son right beside them.  “You replied that when the time came, I would but have to think of you, and you would be by my side.”

	“And I have lived up to my promise to you, my lord.  I am here,” Shakuntala said, and in that moment Sarvadamana could have sworn that even his mother had forgotten that he was there by their side.  But then Shakuntala moved away and looked to Sarvadamana, forcing his father’s gaze to float over to him.  “He does not have your grey eyes, but he carries your insignia, the only memento you left with me.”

	And when his father looked at him, Sarvadamana did what his mother had always told to do if ever accosted by a Puru.  He pulled out his right hand, and displayed the ring on his finger, a moulded metal ring embedded with a moonstone- relic of the Somavansha dynasty.  His father looked to him and then the ring, then looking back at his son with moist eyes.  He moved closer and bent down, bringing his eyes to Sarvadamana’s level.  “What a glorious day this is,” he declared, looking to the men gathered around them.  “On the day that I revive my family’s dynastic heritage, I also receive the symbol to prove it, and an heir to bear it in my stead.  What is your name, my son?”

	“Sarvadamana.”

	His father smiled approvingly.  “Your mother named you well, but today I give you another name.  You bring to me all the joys a man deserves when he has won his battles, you are my cherished one.  I name you Bharata, and for you I will forge a Kingdom stretching from Gandhara to Pratisthana.”

	The twelve year old Sarvadamana had not seen it then, but later in his life, when Bharata would look back to the time his father had accepted him and declared him his heir, he would see the glowering looks of doubt and hostility in the eyes of the men around them.
