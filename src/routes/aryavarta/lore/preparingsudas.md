“It is time, my son,” said King Pijavana, looking at Sudasa with proud eyes.

	“No, it is not, father,” said Sudasa.  “You are of healthy body and mind, and you can still best me in swordplay on your day.  No Bharata King need step down when he is yet as strong as a bear.”

	King Pijavana smiled, and in his mind he thanked Rshi Vasishtha for the humility he inculcated in Sudasa.  “You are twenty-seven years of age now,” the King said.  “It is my duty to hand the throne over to you, and you have proved yourself more than capable for the task.”

	Sudasa bowed in acceptance of his father’s compliments, but he could not accept the throne- not while Pijavana was still more than able.  “Let Mitrayu’s crowning not sway us,” Sudasa said- referring to his cousin who was now the King.  “I wish to see many more decades of my father as King.”

	Pijavana smiled again, knowing that his son spoke from the heart.  “At least fulfill my other desire then,” the King said.  “And that of your mother’s as well.”

	“Marriage,” Sudasa said, well used to his mother’s constant reminders to find a princess for himself.  “I have never refused that suggestion, I have only had limited opportunity to carry out mother’s wishes.”

	“Then let us provide that.  Let us find you a Suryavanshi princess- preferably someone from King Bhagiratha’s close family.  Bhagiratha will be pleased, and I will make arrangements for the journey to Ayodhya right away!”

	Sudasa would have replied, but then they heard the distinct sound of a conch- and both father and son recognized the message beneath its unique, tonal blare.  An army had been spotted by the outpost at Ekachakra- the Yadava city Pijavana annexed thirteen years ago.  It would not have taken more than a few hours for the messenger pigeon to fly from Ekachakra to Prayaga- but an army could easily be upon the outpost by this time.  King and Prince made to move towards the barracks, but Pijavana stopped his son.  “No son- I need you here.  I will lead the forces to Ekachakra.”

	“And I will come with you father- my place is by your side.”

	“No,” Pijavana said firmly- using his Kingly tone.  

	“You said the same to me thirteen years ago,” Sudasa said, “And I was indeed a child then.  But now I am fit to be a King- you have said so yourself.  Do not stop me, father, not this time.  This time, I will not be able to forgive myself for staying back while you and the Bharatas go to war.”

King Subahu Yadava led his entire army to Kampilya, ploughing right through Ekachakra and crossing the Yamuna- word of this reached King Pijavana even before they arrived at Ekachakra.  He furiously redirected his no-small-force in the direction of Kampilya, sending a contingent to take stock of the situation at Ekachakra.  They did not know how large Subahu’s force was, but Kampilya was a military fortress- holding a larger population of warriors than Prayaga.  It would mount a mean defence, especially under the unflinching command of General Vridhakshara- Sudasa’s maternal grandfather.

	King Pijavana sent word to the Bharata contingents stationed in Mathura- warning them to be on the lookout.  Subahu’s direction may be towards Kampilya, but Pijavana could not ignore the possibility that Yadava forces would try to retake Mathura.  By the time his force turned in the direction of Kampilya and gave swift chase, the Yadavas were already close to a day ahead.  They reached Kampilya before Pijavana and Sudasa could catch up with them.  

	And yet there was something fortuitous in that- for the Yadavas were now surrounded by Bharata forces from two sides- forcing King Subahu’s attention away from the city itself.  King Pijavana and General Vridhakshara established contact quickly, though Vridhakshara was trapped on the other side of the battlefield.  Kampilya lay on the Ganga’s western bank, and more than twelve thousand soldiers now amassed at the southern plains outside the city.  Of these, five thousand were Yadavas- and they faced four thousand Kampilyans while another three thousand Bharatas stood at their backs.  Somewhere in that Yadava mass was King Subahu- cleverly hiding his flag for now.  With the Yadavas so surrounded by enemy forces, a carefully aimed arrow could take Subahu’s life, and Sudasa wondered what the Yadava King even hoped to achieve by this strategically imprudent move.    

	“Take the front cavalry,” King Pijavana said.  “Flank the Yadavas from the west- I want to offer Subahu no route of escape.”

	Sudasa nodded.  “There could be a trick to this, father,” he warned.  “It makes no sense for Subahu to march only five thousand men right to Kampilya.  We may not have known the strength of his numbers, but surely he knew of Kampilya’s might?”

	“I agree,” said the King.  “That is why I send you on a western flank.  If Subahu has any secret force joining us, it will be visible from your vantage.  Lookout for it.”

	Sudasa nodded again.  “Take care, father.”

	“Crush them, my son.”

	Sudasa rallied the front cavalry and set off, not knowing then that those would be the last words he ever heard from his father.

***

It was brutal and straightforward battle.  Subahu’s rashness had sandwiched his men between the Bharata contingents, and there was little scope for strategic gameplay for either side.  King Pijavana led his men forward from the south, forcing the Yadavas closer and closer to the city- where Vridhakshara forces gave them no quarter.  

	King Pijavana was a man of the chariot, adept at engaging in the multi-directional battle it necessitated.  His chariot cavalry made several runs through enemy lines- Pijavana’s arrows were a blur, each projectile finding lethal aim.  At the seventh run, the Yadavas finally managed to throttle his rampage.  Two Yadava horsemen ran straight at him, holding a piece of rope between them.  Pijavana’s charioteer spotted the charge too late, and was unable to maneuver the bulky mass out of the way.  The chariot’s horses ran into the rope and tumbled in cacophonous neighs of indignation- these were trained Bharata stallions perceptive of their master’s battle needs.  The chariot churned up in the falling wake like a mighty tide on the rise, and as the back-end reached its peak, Pijavana was flung into the air.  An arrow pierced his shoulder even as he flew, and he fell onto the upheld sword of an expectant Yadava warrior.  The blade cut through his waist, and King Pijavana Bharata roared in excruciating pain.  Gravity flung him right down to the ground, and the blade cut through his waist- splicing out his insides.  Blood poured out of him as if its liquid force had ever yearned to be free, but King Pijavana only found himself chuckling in morbid humour as a tale came to him, narrated by Rshi Vasishtha when Pijavana was a young boy.  It was the tale of Suhotra- elder son of First King Bharata.  Suhotra too had a sword rip through his gut during the Ashvamedha, but the elder son of Bharata had gone on to fight and win.  That would not be Pijavana’s fate though.  His viscera poured out after the blood, and the Bharata King’s heart stopped beating even before the Yadava sword slashed through his throat- separating head from body.

Sudasa preferred the horse.  The mobility, the speed and agility were unmatched.  He knew the merit of chariots, and had first-hand experience of their military advantage.  But as a warrior on the field, he was much more comfortable on the naked stallion than the hulky chariot.  The front cavalry of Prayaga’s royal army was Sudasa’s personal contingent- built from men who accompanied him through King Divodasa’s attack on the Puru Kingdom, years ago.  Several of these men were among those who were bested by the Kurus inside Khandakvana, and Sudasa knew each warrior personally.  

	Galloping ahead of his men, he signaled for sub-contingents to fan out wider, covering a wider arc as they charged towards the mass of Yadava warriors.  Just as Sudasa suspected, Subahu had diverted another contingent towards Mathura, and those Yadavas now approached Kampilya from the west.  Sudasa estimated that the mass was not less than two thousand men strong.  His front cavalry numbered eight hundred, and he was confident that they could rout through the Yadava lines.  The earlier units that fanned out were now in a position to flank the Yadavas from either side, and Sudasa charged into the enemy a second after he signaled for the wide flanks to pierce in.  

	A trained, war-bred stallion was a lethal force in battle.  Sudasa’s mount was attuned to his needs, trained to read his whistles and calls.  It galloped into the Yadava ranks, causing as much damage with its hooves and spikes as Sudasa did with his blade.  Beast and master chalked up countless deaths to their name before the Yadava formations were thrown out of order.  Sudasa did a quick check around him to see that most, if not all, of his front cavalry was still mounted- wreaking as much damage as he did himself.  Sudasa was given a few moments of pride before an injured, bleeding messenger brought the news of his father’s death.

“Crush them,” Sudasa said, feeling oddly hollow and numb.  “That is what he said to me at our last parting.”

	General Vridhakshara put a comforting hand on his grandson’s shoulder.  He was a veteran of countless wars, and mentor to Pijavana when he was young.  Kings and warriors could be replaced- he knew that.  But fathers could not.  “And so we will,” he said with conviction.  “Take charge of the men, Sudasa.  You are their King now.  They reel with the same sentiment of vengeance, rally them together.”

	Sudasa took a deep breath, nodding.  “Find the body,” he commanded to the attendant soldiers.  “And find the Yadava who beheaded a Bharata King.”

	The battle continued to rage on the main field.  Bharata soldiers were trained, hardy men who could fight even when their King was dead.  Pijavana’s death galvanized the forces, each Bharata soldier taking twice as many Yadava lives as he would otherwise.  King Subahu was no less cornered than before, and with Sudasa having dealt with the Yadava forces from Mathura, Subahu was marked for death as much as each of his men.  

	Sudasa mounted his horse, grimly aware that the men now glanced to him as King, not Crown Prince.  The fifteenth King of the Bharata dynasty nodded to General Vridhakshara and waded into battle, determined to deal with the Yadava menace with finality.  Crush them, his father had said to him.  And thus he did, raining death upon the Yadava ranks as Indra descended upon the Asuras.  The front cavalry and the King took the charge in wiping the Yadavas out- ensuring that no Yadava escaped the plains of Kampilya alive.  Sudasa gave them no respite at night either, letting the battle go on through the light of torches and a fickle moon.  He knew that several of his men died as well, but deep in the heat of battle and vengeance himself, he cared not.  The sun was well up the next day before King Subahu’s head was brought to him by the victorious Bharata soldiers.  King Pijavana’s head and body were reclaimed too, and Sudasa performed his father’s funeral ceremony by the Ganga, even as Yadavas continued to die in the background.  The day passed into evening before every Yadava’s life was taken, but Sudasa knew that he had not truly crushed the enemy.  Not yet.

The Grand Bharat Kings were in grim war counsel.  There was King Mitrayu from Vinasana, young and aggressive.  King Devaratha of Kaushambhi- recently crowned by his ageing father.  King Pratardana of Kashi- wise and experienced.  King Janmejaya of the Kurus and finally, Sudasa- only a month old as King.

	King Dilipa of the Suryavansha was present as well, for he was friend and ally to the Tritsu Bharatas of Prayaga.
