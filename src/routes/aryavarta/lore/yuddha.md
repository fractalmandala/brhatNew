Messengers rode in from the battlefield on a daily basis, bringing news of the war between Bharata and Yadava.  Sudasa made sure he was ready in wait for every messenger to arrive, always dreading the worst.  But the Bharata army was meeting with success at every turn.  The united forces of Kings Pijavana, Vishvaratha, and Divodasa routed Mathura, and threw the Yadavas into chaos.  Now the Bharata army marched to Ekachakra, and there it would be supplemented by men from Kashi, led by the Crown Prince Pratardana.  

	Sudasa was unable to supress his earnest desire to join his father and uncles in battle.  He spent increasingly long hours in the barracks, shadowing the movements of soldiers as they practiced well into the sunset.  Devaratha accompanied him, albeit somewhat reluctantly.  In the evenings they would ride to Rshi Vasishtha’s ashrama, where Devaratha shared Sudasa’s appetence for the Rshi’s tales.  

	War was upon Bharatvarsha, but life in Prayaga continued as usual.  Boats plied up and down the river with regular frequency.  Copper, bronze and clay-ware came in from the northern cities- Kampilya, Kanyakubja and Ahikshetra.  From Kashi and Kaushambhi, traders brought wood, ropes and fabrics that found high demand even outside the borders of Bharatvarsha.  The city also had a bustling internal trade network- milk, vegetables and earthenware were produced in abundance, and bartered in the local marketplaces.  Prayaga was in a constant state of growth- unorganised residential and commercial settlements continued to spread along its outskirts, and the latest census reports had pegged the population at eight thousand.  

	Two months after the campaign against the Yadavas began, Crown Prince Pratardana and his contingent of Kashi soldiers returned.  Word was that the Rakshasas of Naimisharanya had begun gathering forces around Kashi and Ayodhya- to them the various Arya tribes were one, dangerous enemy.  King Satyadhriti of Kashi wanted his son by his side, and the soldiers of Kashi had already given much during the attack on Mathura.  Now they had to be back home, standing in defence of their own city should the need arise.  Sudasa and Devaratha managed to catch some time with Pratardana, while he rested and took nourishment inside the royal residence.

	“How many men have we lost?”  Was the first question Sudasa heard himself ask.  

	Pratardana looked at his cousins, knowing that their childhoods would soon end, and their services needed on the battlefield.  “Too many,” he replied grimly.  “My contingent is shorter by eighty-nine brave men, and the losses were graver among the men under Kings Pijavana and Vishvaratha.  They would have been even greater, were it not for the valiant, lethal men sent by King Divodasa.”  

	“More will die at Ekachakra, won’t they?”  Devaratha asked, his tone making it seem more like a statement than a query.   

	All Pratardana could do was nod.  He set off for Kashi that very evening, and Devaratha and Sudasa made their way to Rshi Vasishtha’s ashrama.  Vasishtha was waiting by the river when they arrived, flames of the bonfire dancing in his moist, twinkling eyes.  

	“Ikshvaku’s story is in great part also the story of the men he inspired,” Vasishtha started.  “You have already heard the tales of Haryashva, and in time I will tell you more of his friendship with Ikshvaku.  But today, I want to tell you about the founder of the Lunar Dynasty.  He was Ikshvaku’s nephew, you see!”

***

**Year 37, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

The young boy was in awe, never having seen a place so grand.  Colours were everywhere, new smells greeted him, and there were all sorts of noises and music coming from the streets.  Nor had he seen so many people together at once, there had to be hundreds gathered outside the Rajavasa! 

His mother walked up to him, smiling at the wonder in the boy’s eyes.  “Are you ready to go, Pururava?  Your uncle awaits you.”

Much as he wanted to stay and continue looking out to the crowded streets, Pururava also wanted to meet his uncle.  He followed his mother into the doorway, and a new wave of smells greeted him, all captivating.  Inside, his eyes went to the tall, straight men that stood by the sides- dressed in bronze and wood armour.  A beautiful, radiant woman walked up to them with a broad smile on her face and said, “Ila, how great that you could make this journey!”  There was genuine delight upon her face.

“How could we not,” Pururava’s mother, Ila replied.  “And Pururava has been dying to meet my brother!”

That, Pururava thought, was unwarranted.  Sure, he was eager to meet his uncle, but did mother have to say that and make him look like a boy?  He was twelve now, only three years short of the age at which his Uncle had become King.

The radiant woman turned her attention to Pururava, and her smile widened further.  “How have you grown!”  She exclaimed.  “Come, Ikshvaku will be pleased to see you.”  She led Ila and Pururava through another doorway where the boy found two men seated on mats of grass, and laughing over a joke.  At their entry, they turned their attention towards the doorway and the younger man’s eyes lit up.  He stood up in a flash, and the other man followed.

“Ila!  Finally you have arrived.  My scouts reported more than a day ago that your caravan had been sighted.”  He pulled Ila into a tight embrace, then turned his attention to Pururava.

He was taller than anyone Pururava had ever seen, and he stooped low to bring his head to Pururava’s level.  “And this must be my little nephew,” he said, and that was when Pururava realized that this was Ikshvaku, the Suryavansha King.  Ikshvaku’s appearance was nothing like what Pururava had expected.  The King looked much older than his nineteen years.  His hair was long and wavy, and a strong stubble layered his face.  His hands were thick and muscular, while his chest and shoulders jutted out wide and firm.  When he held his hands out to hold Pururava, the boy noticed numerous cuts and scars on them, and a faint scar running across his throat.  

“Pururava,” Ila said, “Pay your respects to the King.”

Pururava folded his hands in the traditional greeting, but Ikshvaku clasped them with a wide grin on his face.  “He looks so much like our father,” Ikshvaku said to Ila, “The same nose and jaw line.”

Ila beamed.  “Father has said as much himself.  But Pururava has taken his hair and grey eyes from his own father.  Speaking of ours, has he arrived as yet?”

Some of the pleasantness vanished from Ikshvaku’s face.  “Father will not be joining us,” he replied.  “With the birth of more sons, I fear he has his hands full.”  He turned to the man next to him and said, “This is Haryashva, my dear friend and an Ashvaka from Kapisa.”

Pururava’s eyes widened.  He had heard much about this Ashvaka, who was well known as the King’s right hand man.  A few years ago, when Ikshvaku was injured during the Yaksha campaigns in the north, it was Haryashva who rushed to him and whisked him away to safety.  When you grow to be a ruler of men yourself, his mother always said, you must find loyal and capable men like Ikshvaku found Haryashva. 

Haryashva bowed and brought his palms together in a namaskara.  “It is an honour to meet you, Ila devi.  The King often talks of his sister.”

Ila nodded with a smile.  “And I have heard much about you, brave Haryashva.  I have you to thank for saving my brother’s life.”

“Only after he saved my life a dozen times earlier, my lady,” Haryashva humbly replied.

Ikshvaku chuckled pleasantly.  “Haryashva is stubbornly humble, Ila.  Except when it comes to his abilities as a rider.  He has accepted me as his King, but he refuses to accept that I ride the horse much better.”

“Because you don’t,” Haryashva replied, and Pururava was surprised to hear him talk to the King in such a manner.  Both men exchanged a chuckle, and Ila smiled at their mirth.  “Can I see the boys now?”  She asked.

Ikshvaku turned to the woman who had led them in, and Pururava realized that she was one of his wives.  “Nivritti and the newborn boy are resting,” the woman replied, referring to Ikshvaku’s second wife, “But Vikukshi is up and about with the nurse maid.”

 “Vikukshi?”  Ila asked.  “I thought you named your firstborn Kshuva, after our father.”

“We had,” Ikshvaku replied, “But Maharshi Vasishtha suggested that a name beginning with Va would be more auspicious, and Sarmi here favoured Vikukshi.  His official title is Kshuva Vikukshi.  That way our father is honoured as well.”

“Enough chatter,” Sarmi interrupted, and Pururava couldn’t help but notice that Ikshvaku’s first wife truly was as beautiful as he had heard.  A daughter of one of Maharshi Kashyapa’s scholastic lineages, her marriage to Ikshvaku was a union blessed by venerated personalities like Vasishtha and the Manu.  “You can meet Vikukshi shortly, but let us seat ourselves first.  Ila and Pururava must be famished after their long journey.”

Pururava was famished indeed.  The journey from Plaksha to Avisari had taken four long weeks, and only because Ikshvaku had sent the best horses from Kapisa.  They subsisted on wild berries and baked flour all through the journey.  He followed the elders as they sat on the grass mats, and waited hungrily while the food was placed in front of him.  The rice here was slender and long, more appetizing to the eye and palate both.  And the spices were milder, with a sweet aftertaste to them.  The elders made more small talk as they ate, and Ikshvaku and Haryashva made several quips and japes at each other.  On a few occasions Pururava’s gaze met Ikshvaku’s, and the King looked at him with friendly, twinkling eyes.  After the meal, Pururava was able to meet the third famed figure among the Suryavanshi- Maharshi Vasishtha.

People said that Vasishtha was more than a hundred years old, but Ila had rubbished such stories for Pururava long ago.  Vasishtha was younger than Kashyapa or Atri after all, but he did indeed look as old as death itself.  His beard hung in clumps of hair, white and sparse enough that all the wrinkles of his skin were visible from underneath.  His eyelids were droopy, making him look almost sleepy and dazed.  The only thing young about him was his hair, which despite its bright, white colour was surprisingly dense and youthful.  They were also joined by another man, fierce and barrel-chested.  Pururava soon learnt that he was Senapati Drishta- formidable commander of the Suryavanshi army.  Sarmi disappeared and returned a little while later cradling the infant Vikukshi, depositing him in the eager arms of Ila.

“Maharshi Vasishtha,” said Senapati Drishta, “Please share with the King what we discussed earlier.  He refuses to hear my counsel on this.”

Ikshvaku’s demeanor had changed visibly now.  He looked more like a King than the teenage cousin that greeted Ila some moments ago.  There was a grim and regal bearing upon his face.  “Are you talking about the proposal to shift our capital, Senapati?”  He asked.

“I am, my King, and Maharshi Vasishtha agrees that the proposal is wise.”

Ikshvaku turned to Vasishtha, who said, “Avisari is no place to build a capital, Ikshvaku.  You are inaccessible here, and your armies are surrounded by mountainous terrain.  Now that Kamyakvana has been successfully cleared of all Rakshasas, it makes sense for you to shift south, near the Iravati.”

Ikshvaku bowed his head slightly, indicating that he respected the Maharshi’s words.  “I hear your counsel, Guru, but I see it differently.  The very fact that Avisari is remote makes this an impenetrable capital.  On the plains of the Iravati, we could be surrounded from all sides, vulnerable to siege.  Moreover, there are still bands of Yakshas running wild in the mountains, and shifting the capital away from them at this time sends the wrong message.”

“If I may intervene,” said Ila as she rocked baby Vikukshi in her arms, “The south needs you, Ikshvaku.  People there only hear of the great Suryavanshi, not see their might or benefit from it.  All along the Shatadru, Sarasvati and Yamuna our towns are pillaged by wandering Yaksha, Gandharva and Rakshasa raiders.  By shifting down to the Iravati, you can send your armies to protect those fledging settlements.”

Ikshvaku turned to Haryashva for his opinion, who shrugged and said, “You are already building a military outpost at Kapisa.  That can protect these lands should the need arise.  If the eventual aim, as you often state, is to colonise the Sindhu down to where it meets the ocean, then at some point you will have to shift south.”

“I need not do the shifting myself,” Ikshvaku countered.  “I have two sons now, who can be my regents when they come of age.  And what of my brothers- Pramshu, Nabhaga and Sharyati?  They need lands to colonise as well.  What of your own son, my sister?  If I send the Suryavanshi down to the Yamuna, those lands will be claimed by my son when he becomes King.  Are you ready for that?”

No one replied, then Senapati Drishta spoke up.  “At least take my counsel on the other matter, my King.  Your brothers and sons are around the same age, they will come of coronation age at the same time.  There is no law stating that your son should be the Suryavanshi King before your brother, and so Pramshu or Sharyati could stake a claim on the throne as much as Vikukshi could.”

“Your counsel being?”  Ikshvaku asked, an impatient tinge to his voice.

Senapati Drishta turned to Vasishtha again, who said, “Primogeniture, the right of the firstborn to inherit the wealth and powers of his father.  Institute this practice, Ikshvaku, before your brothers are of age to protest it.  Make it law that the firstborn becomes King after his father.  That way, your elder son will be protected.”

Ikshvaku chuckled.  “And what will become of my second son, the son who hasn’t even been named yet?”

“As the King, it will always be in your discretion to split your territories among your sons,” Vasishtha suggested.  “But no other son of the Manu could stake a claim on the Kingship.”

Ikshvaku sighed.  “Well,” he said, “At least that’s better than the alternative Haryashva presents to me.  If I do it his way, I would have my brothers assassinated!”

“What!”  Blurted Ila.  “That’s a horrible proposition.  You could never do that!”

“Indeed,” Ikshvaku replied.  “And so it seems I will have to institute this practice of primogeniture.  Very well, if I refuse both to shift the capital and to institute the practice, I fear you all might denounce me as King.  Let us have the practice then, and I stay in Avisari.”  He said it in a tone of finality, a tone that announced that no further discussion could happen on the matter.  Pururava stared in admiration, how could Ikshvaku command so much power at such a young age?  Even Maharshi Vasishtha fell silent once Ikshvaku made his decision known.  

The others nodded, and Ikshvaku turned his full attention to Pururava.  “Come now,” he said, “Let me spend some time with my nephew.  Can you ride a horse, Pururava?”

“I can,” Pururava said with confidence.

“Then let us take a ride, while your mother meets my wives and sons.  Come.”  Ikshvaku stood up and Haryashva with him, but the King placed a hand on his friend’s shoulder and said gently, “No, my friend.  I wish to have this ride with my nephew alone.”  Haryashva made no protest, and Pururava followed his uncle in anticipation.

***

“Your lineage is as glorious as mine, if not more,” Ikshvaku commented once they were trotting their horses out of Avisari.  “Quite a lot of expectations on your shoulders.”

Pururava did not know what to say to that, so he simply said, “There were a lot of expectations on your shoulders.”

“So there were.  I would say that you can ask your mother about it, but then she’s probably writing that story with you now.”

Again Pururava did not know what to say.  Ikshvaku was in a third mood now.  The first had been the jovial, affectionate uncle that greeted him.  The second was the grim, firm King who refused to shift his capital.  This was the third- a pensive, brooding rider.

“How fares your great-grandfather, the Maharshi Atri?  It has been years since I had the fortune of being in his presence.”

“He is getting old,” Pururava replied, happy to have something normal to converse about.  “He rarely steps out of his hut now, and prefers to eat his food in liquid form.”

“The first generation greats are all getting old,” Ikshvaku commented.  “My own great-grandfather, Maharshi Kashyapa, has seen more than a hundred years.”

They passed out of the town walls, and made their way through the crowded market streets outside Avisari proper.  Everyone recognized Ikshvaku and make way for him, many rushed to kneel around his horse and shouted words of praise and gratitude.  Quite a few young women placed themselves around his horses’ path, hastily brushing their hair or adjusting their dresses strategically.  Pururava noted that the people of Avisari looked healthy and happy, and they seemed to truly love their King.  Once beyond the market, the land stretched flat before climbing steeply up to the high mountains.  Here Ikshvaku gave pace to his horse and set it off at a gallop.  Pururava followed, his horse matching Ikshvaku’s gallop for gallop.  They raced till they reached the rising climb and worked up a healthy sweat.  Pururava felt sore and tired, but Ikshvaku looked positively rejuvenated.

“This is why I cannot leave Avisari,” Ikshvaku said as he sipped some water from a pouch and tossed it to Pururava.  “I belong with the horses and the mountains, neither of which are at home in the riverlands.  Were I not the King it wouldn’t matter, I could be an inconspicuous rider in the far north, battling Yakshas by day and sleeping huddled in blanketskins by night.  But such anonymity is not available to boys like us, is it?”

Pururava noticed that Ikshvaku used the term ‘boys’, not ‘men.’  For the first time since he met him, Pururava realised that his uncle was a boy too, with the same adolescent desires and motives as any other boy.  

“There is something I want to discuss with you, Pururava,” Ikshvaku continued, and some of the Kingly mood was back.  “I need your mother’s permission for this, but I want to know if you are ready.  Your mother is preparing you for reign, I know that, but there are many ways where her preparation will fall short.  She is well protected by the men our father has served to her, and by extension so are you.  But no man can be King till he can protect himself and those around him.  And you have had no training yet.  You do not know the ways of the sword and shield, of blood and grime.”

“Mother says that I am too young for all that,” Pururava said.  Then he hastened to add, “But I disagree.”

Ikshvaku nodded approvingly.  “Good,” he said.  “Then come join me here in Avisari.  You will train under Senapati Drishta and Haryashva the Ashvaka.  You will learn archery, sword fighting, horse riding and so much more.  You will join raids against the Yakshas and Rakshasas, learning by doing.  I began training at the age of nine, had my first battle at the age of thirteen, and was King by fifteen.  Since then, I have battled more than I have ruled.  If you are to be a ruler, as your mother desires, then you must be capable of rule.  In Avisari, I can provide that training to you.  Would you join?”

“Yes!”  Pururava said, unable to hide his excitement.

Ikshvaku smiled at his nephew’s enthusiasm.  “We will need your mother’s permission, of course, but I do not think she would refuse.  It will be good, my young boys will have an elder brother around them.  And Senapati Drishta will appreciate a new ward as capable as his previous.”
