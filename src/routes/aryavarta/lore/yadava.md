Now they occupy a unique position in Aryavarta- most populous, but on the fringes; descended from Kings but no mighty rulers themselves.

“Why did King Yayati choose Puru?”  Sudasa asked.  “Why did Yadu not inherit the central Kingdom?”

	“There are many theories to that, young one,” Vasishtha replied.  “The first, I have already shared with you- that Yayati was especially fond of his youngest son.  Some say that the decision was influenced by Puru’s mother- she was Yayati’s favourite, and Puru hers.  Then there are those who believe that Yayati was swayed by Puru’s grey eyes.  In him, the physical features characteristic of the Somavansha were distinctly present, far more than in Yadu or the others.”

	“And what is your theory, guruji?”  

	“I believe that King Yayati was compelled to choose Puru.  His other sons were needed to protect the Kingdom’s outer colonies- which Puru was incapable of sustaining.  The northern regions around Loha were pliable only to the iron reign of Turvasa; Anu was consummately familiar with the fortress of Girivraja, and the only son apt as its commander; and the brothers Druhyu and Yadu were needed to protect against both Suryavansha and Dasa.  Yes, any of the others could have been able Kings at Pratisthana, but Puru would not have survived anywhere else.  He was the youngest among them, after all.”

	“And what happened to the other brothers after that?”  Sudasa asked.  He was fascinated by Yadu.  King Yayati’s eldest son was a capable and adept ruler by all accounts, yet his tribe was consigned to taking the backseat to Puru, Suryavansha and then even Bharata.  Here was a man fit to be King, yet denied what was rightfully his.  Was it any wonder that his descendants were now the Bharatas’ most vicious enemy?  

	“Each of Yayati’s sons were begetters to tribes of their name,” Vasishtha replied.  “And in a few generations after the five brothers, there were conflicts even within them.  Today, the Druhyus are more or less indistinguishable from Dasas.  They gave us two glorious cities in Sivobheda and Mohandvara.”

	“King Prithu, the brother of Aneni?”

	Vasishtha smiled.  “Yes, young one.  Prithu’s tale now merges with that of the Yadavas and Druhyus.  You already know that Yadu was made King of the South.  After his death, Ekachakra went to his elder son, Kroshta- kind and gentle.  But Ujjayani went to Haihaya, the younger- cunning and malevolent.  Let us now pick up the tale of Haihaya and his son, Dharma.  Together, they will clash against the Prithu you already know of.”

**Year 250, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

Haihaya spat obscenely, deliberately directing it towards the feet of his prisoner.  The prisoner continued to ignore his belligerence, but he noted a hint of trepidation in those eyes.  “Perhaps I should give you to my men,” he said.  “The fun they get here is sparse and feeble.  But an Apsara, now that is another thing altogether, isn’t it?”  He turned to his men as he asked that, and they looked at the Apsara woman hungrily.  There was no doubt that, if he so desired, Haihaya would easily come true on this threat.

	“Wipe!”  He commanded, and a timid assistant gently wiped the sweat off his face and arms before withdrawing into the curtains.  Haihaya yanked at the Apsara’s hair to pull her face up, but she continued to maintain her silence.  “She is quite beautiful,” he remarked.  “I think my forefather Pururava was quite a lucky man!”  He paused, and the men around him chuckled.  “But why did he have to marry into such a wretched tribe?”  He asked to no one in particular.  “And what’s the difference anyway, between Gandharva and Apsara?”

	“I believe they are related tribes,” replied Arka, Haihaya’s prime counsel.  “Just like you can trace a common ancestor with the Suryavansha, my King, the Gandharvas and Apsaras trace a common ancestor.”

	Haihaya snorted.  “Enough proof that ancestors count for naught.  The Suryavansha are my enemy, and the Gandharvas and Apsaras are at each other’s throats, common forefathers be damned.”

	“What are we to do with this one?”  Asked Arka, gesturing to the captive Apsara with a greedy look in his eyes.

	Haihaya considered before replying, “Let Bagha and Bheera have a go at her.  If she still doesn’t talk, you may do with her as you please.”

	Arka was grinning widely as he dragged the Apsara out to the next set of tormentors.  Haihaya captured her for the intelligence she could give on Suryavanshi movements along the Sindhu, but when she was Arka’s prisoner, the intent would be entirely different.

Ujjayani was by all appearances a town of Suryavanshi design.  The same blueprints that built the now deserted city of Rajavasa went into the construction of Ujjayani.  It was flanked on its south and eastern sides by the outer foothills of the Vindhyachala mountain range.  The Charmanvati River cut through it, separating its large mining complex from the town proper.  Capital of the Yadavas, Ujjayani was a town with mines that ran all day and night- a feat previously accomplished only by Trigarta and Madra.  At the north end of Charmanvati was the city of Ekachakra, another prime seat of the Yadava clan, and ruled by Kroshta, Haihaya’s elder brother.  But while Ekachakra was a city of rshis and mantras, Ujjayani was a town of soot and grease.  Just like the waters of the Charmanvati, wealth flowed away from Ekachakra and into Ujjayani, through the latter’s near monopoly on bronze, copper and wootz steel.

	Kalpavana dragged his net back, assessing his haul of fish even before it was back on the boat.  Behind him, his wife Suryati gently adjusted the sails to keep them well away from the rocky banks.  The Charmanvati never met the ocean, and its waters were always fresh and crisp.  Up north, where it emerged out of the Yamuna, the waters were saline; and the Charmanvati fish never strayed there.  Here, so close to Ujjayani, hundreds of schools swam tentatively along the banks, trying to avoid the jagged rocks much like Suryati did.  A single cast of the net brought in dozens of fish, and that allowed Kalpavana to run a profitable business.  He would use the winds to sail a fair bit upstream, away from Ujjayani, before turning back around and using the river’s natural flow while he dragged in hundreds of fish.  Ujjayani was a liberal town, not given to the moral peculiarities of the north.  The people here loved their fish, and there was a healthy trade of all sorts of sea food with the Naga town of Kushasthali further west.

	It was Suryati’s first time out fishing with him.  She had been badgering him for months, and when he found the winds to be safe enough he relented, giving her some basic training so she may adjust the sails if needed.  He had never been able to say no her, once she set her mind to something.  “They say that there is more money in pottery and crafting these days than fishing,” she commented above the gushing sound of the river.

	“And who is they exactly?”  Kalpavana asked.

	“People,” she replied, “All over the town.  They say that the fishermen are a lowly people, earning a living out of the death of other life forms.  Look at Yuddhi, our neighbour.  In a short span of five years, he has become the head of a copper shreni.”

	“I know what he has done to achieve that,” Kalpavana replied.  “I have no desire to subvert my principles such.”

	“Why, what has he done?”  Suryati asked.

	Kalpavana shook his head dismissively.  “It’s not important.  As long as King Haihaya rules Ujjayani, we fishermen will have a business to run.”

	“Precisely!”  Suryati said, trying to push her point.  “How long do you think will King Haihaya be able to withstand the Suryavansha?  Now that the Suryavanshi and the Dasas have made peace, King Prithu’s attention will finally turn to Ujjayani.  And don’t forget that west of us is Naga territory.  The Nagas have descended from Sharyati, brother of Ikshvaku.  King Prithu’s armies will march here with full force!”

	Kalpavana turned to his wife and scrutinized her.  Where was she getting her news from?  Aloud he said, “And what will you have me do, woman?  Leave the only vocation I have, and thus our sustenance?”

	Suryati shook her head in the negative, knowing well that her husband’s will was now within grasp.  “It is not the only means of sustenance we have.  Let us move to Ekachakra, or even Sivobheda or Viratpuri.  There are enough mining shrenis there, and you can find a good job.  We don’t need to deal with death and blood like this.”

	Kalpavana chuckled.  “You talk as if I’m a warrior, not a simple fisherman.  Ujjayani is our home, Suryati.  You and I were born here, were married here, and I want my son to be born here as well.”

	“What makes you so sure it’s a son?”

	“It better be,” Kalpavana warned, only half in jest.

	“Halt!”  A loud, booming voice carried over to them.  Kalpavana turned his head to see a large boat headed their way.  It had the distinguishable banners of Yadava, and Kalpavana counted at least five rowers on either side. 

	“Identify yourself,” the same voice commanded from the boat.  

	“I am Kalpavana, a fisherman of Ujjayani.  And this is my wife, Suryati.”

	The man on the boat was pushed aside roughly, and a younger one stepped forward.  This one had the unmistakable air of royalty around him- in the way he held himself, and the way the others stepped aside to make space for him.  Kalpavana took half a second to recognize the ugly, scarred face of Crown Prince Dharma, son of King Haihaya and grandson of the great Yadu.  He brought his knees down to the boat’s floor, and bowed his head in obeisance, Suryati following suit.

	Crown Prince Dharma was a man of violent tastes.  He was known to enter into physical brawls with men and beasts alike, reflected by the angry scars on his face.  Twice he had attempted to wrest power from his father, and as a young commander of sixteen years he laid siege upon Revasthali, retreating only when he lost all his army, save himself and his personal guard.  Never married, he had a harem of more than a hundred women, brought from both within Aryavarta and outside.  Unknown to King Haihaya, Dharma also ran a booming ivory trade business with shores beyond the great western sea.

	He surveyed the fisherman and his wife now, his eyes resting on the woman’s curves and the slim, fair waist visible beneath her draperies.  Lust came quick to Dharma as always, and he decided immediately that the woman had to be a part of his harem.  “Bring us closer,” he commanded to his aide, signalling towards Kalpavana’s boat.    

	“Woman,” he barked when they were close enough to jump from one boat to another, “Take off your clothes and show yourself to me.”

	Kalpavana started, and Suryati looked towards him with fearful eyes.  “My lord,” he protested.

	Dharma frowned, he was not a man given to patience.  “Do as I say, or my men will enforce it quite brutally.”

	Suryati was close to tears now, and Kalpavana nervously wrung his hands.  They knew what fate awaited Suryati if Prince Dharrma liked what he saw.  In a split second, Kalpavana made his decision.  Before any of the Haihayas could react, he jumped at their boat, his hands going straight for the sword dangling by Dharma’s waist.  He barely heard Suryati’s anguished cry in the background, and by the time he yanked half the sword out, he felt a sharp clasp at the back of his head.

	No sooner did he collapse to the ground that Dharma pulled his sword out, and cleanly pushed it through Kalpavana’s gut.  Suryati’s cry was a moan now, and it merged into the ripping sounds of fabric, skin and tissue as Crown Prince Dharma slit Kalpavana open from stomach to throat.  When he was done he looked to Suryati with a greedy, malicious grin.  “Now, woman,” he said, voice dripping with lust, “Your husband’s foolish act has only excited me further.  I am going to have you right here and now.”  He gestured to his men, and Suryati backed away as they stepped onto her boat.  Blood still gushed out of her slain husband’s body, and as the men closed in she made a decision of her own.  Sending a silent prayer to the Devas above, she flung herself into the water from the other side of the boat, hoping to be dashed against the rocky banks by the Charmanvati’s merciful flow.

“I need you to go to Ekachakra,” said the father to the son.  It was met with insolent eyes.  “It is not a request,” the father added.

	“And why is that?”  Dharma asked, aware that he was the only man who could question the King such, and get away with it. 

	King Haihaya smiled his favourite, malevolent grin.  “You are going to my brother to beg,” Haihaya said, satisfied at the confused look on his son’s face.  His only son, Dharma was unfortunately an incapable fool.  He had Haihaya’s temper, aggression and maverick attitude without the cold, tempered intelligence.  But then, King Haihaya was brought up by the formidable strategist- Yadu, whereas Dharma grew up amid his father’s cronies and sycophants.  

	“Beg for what, father?”  Dharma asked at last, regaining his nonchalant composure.

	“Men,” Haihaya replied, “And weapons, horses, rations, battle tents- everything they can spare.”

	For once Dharma was quick on the uptake.  “We are going to war?”  He asked, eyes alive with excitement.

	“No, you are,” Haihaya replied, happy with this final blow.  The farther that Dharma was from Ujjayani, the better.  And while he was at it, if he dealt some blows to the Suryavansha, then even better.  Haihaya was tired of the Suryavanshi nuisance.  They had a large Kingdom, starting from Avisari in the north and stretching down to Vitabhya.  Apart from their Ashvaka colonies, they covered the entire tract of land between the Sindhu and Shatadru rivers- the Panchab.  Having made his peace with the Dasas for now, King Prithu of the Suryavansha had turned his attention further south of Vitabhya- to the new, wealthy towns of Sivobheda, Puskara, Ujjayani and Kushasthali.  “You are to go help my dear uncle, King Druhyu.  He plans to attack Vitabhya from the south.  You are to take our armies, cross the Sarasvati near Viratpuri, and attack Vitabhya from the east.  If the last part of this grand attack materializes, then a rebel band of Dasas will attack the town from the west.”

	Dharma looked content with that, and he allowed himself a smirk.  “The Suryavansha won’t expect a thing,” he said.

	“In fact, they will know that we are coming,” Haihaya said, again pleased that he caught his son off guard.  “Once you get the help we need from Ekachakra, I intend to send message to King Prithu and warn him of the attack.  Years ago, when the old Suryavansha capital of Rajavasa was attacked by Dasas, King Ikshvaku and the Suryavansha were taken by surprise.  I want King Prithu to have no such excuse, when yet another Suryavanshi King loses his capital and his life.”

	“I take it that you will join us for that final act?”  Dharma asked.

	“Depends on how you fare, my son.”  

***

King Prithu made the messenger repeat his message twice.  At the end of it, he was fuming.  Haihaya had always been belligerent and dangerous, but this move was unprecedented.  Vitabhya was far off from Ujjayani, with the entire Sindhu basin separating the two cities.  Prithu always hoped that, sooner or later, the wealth of Kushasthali would be too enticing for Haihaya, and he would make his move towards the Naga capital.  But now it seemed as if the Yadava King had higher ambitions.  Let them come, was Prithu’s first instinct to react.  But then he caught himself and looked to Vasishtha, the Rajpurohit. 

	“What do we make of this, Rshi Vasishtha?”  The King asked.

	Shakti Vasishtha was a descendant of the great Maharshi Vasishtha of the Manu’s time, or so he claimed at least.  Close to two hundred years had passed since the Maharshi’s death, and the lines that separated his descendants and pupils were no longer distinct.  But descendant or not, Shakti Vasishtha had more than proven his worth to the Suryavansha King, and Prithu turned to him for all counsel.

	“I do not think that this is a trick,” Vasishtha observed calmly.  “It is in Haihaya’s nature to be brazen and bold.”

	“But not stupid,” Prithu said.  “There is more to this than he reveals.”  Prithu turned to the messenger as he said that, and the man averted his gaze.  “Tell me,” the King asked, “What is Crown Prince Dharma up to these days?” 

	“The Crown Prince will lead King Haihaya’s armies to Vitabhya,” the messenger replied obediently.  “But forgive me, King, I am forbidden from saying anything else.”

	“Of course you are,” Prithu said to him.  He turned to Senapati Kala, the Suryavanshi armies’ commander and said, “I do not want to get into a situation like Ikshvaku in Rajavasa.”

	“We need not,” Senapati Kala replied.  “I will install contingents outside the city limits, making them encamp in the directions of Sivobheda and Ekachakra.  We will engage the enemy before they can even set sight on Vitabhya.”

	“Very well.  Also, send riders to Sakala, Avisari and Kapisa,” Prithu said.  “And send word to my distant cousin, Pusya Janaka.  I don’t think it likely, but let us see if he can convince King Kroshta to reign in his younger brother.”

	At that moment the grand doors were slammed opened, and two soldiers stepped in with another man dressed in Yadava regalia.  They walked up to the King and forced the man to his knees.  “This is another messenger from Ujjayani,” one of the soldiers informed Prithu.  “He claims that the previous messenger brings false news intended to misguide you, and that he comes with the true message from King Haihaya.”

	Prithu’s lips curved and he glanced towards Vasishtha, who had a twinkling, knowing look to his eyes.  “And what might this message be?”  The King asked.

	The messenger tried to get to his feet, but was pushed back down by the soldier.  He delivered his message on his knees, “King Haihaya sends his son to you as a gesture of good faith.  For too long he has been troubled by Crown Prince Dharma.  He recently learnt that Crown Prince Dharma has made secret pacts with the Naga King Rocamana.  King Haihaya is also aware that there is no love between the Suryavansha and the Nagavansha.  What he proposes is this- he sends Crown Prince Dharma to your doors, for you to take care of him.  In return, he will take care of the Nagas for you.”

	“And what happens when both are taken care of, and King Haihaya grows bored again?”  Senapati Kala demanded to know.

	“That was not told to me,” the messenger said matter-of-factly.  The first messenger was now staring at him, clearly caught unawares by the new arrival, and the content of his message.  

	“And King Haihaya will tolerate his only son being slain by a Suryavanshi, outside the Suryavanshi capital?”

	“Again, that was not told to me,” the messenger replied.  “I am only to return with your answer, King Prithu.  Do you accept my King’s proposal, or do you not?”

	Prithu looked to Vasishtha, silently asking for counsel and strangely enough, getting it through Vasishtha’s own silence.  “I do not,” he replied finally.  “Tell your King, that any army that marches towards Suryavansha territory is an enemy.  If the approaching army bears the Yadava banners, then I will take the source of the threat to be Ujjayani.  My armies will not distinguish between father and son.”
