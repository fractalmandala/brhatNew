> I reiterate that ancient division, and cast you forever beyond the Sindhu.  You are Anarya from here on- ignoble to our eyes.  Dasa, Druhyu, Yadava, Puru- all are the same to me.  We are Arya and you are not.  Bharatvarsha is Aryavarta and Aryavarta is Bharatvarsha<br><cite>Sudasa Bharata to Shimyu Puru</cite>

In the days following his return from war, Pijavana announced that Sudasa’s martial training would commence soon.  “This is not to hasten your entry into the warrior world, my son,” Pijavana explained.  “But I am likely to be away in battle with increasing frequency, and we cannot have Prayaga’s crown prince unprepared for the role of a King.”

At the next lesson with Rshi Vasishtha, Sudasa greeted his teacher and spoke before the former could begin.  “Today I wish to ask something of you, Rshi Vasishtha,” he said.  “It is a part of our history that we are never taught, something we never question.”

	“And what would that be, my young pupil?”

	“What does Arya mean?  Where does this word come from?  How do we determine who is Arya, and who is not?”

	Rshi Vasishtha sighed.  It was a mark of how advanced a student Sudasa was, that he asked something even Vasishtha could only speculate over.  “That is a tough query to grapple with,” he admitted.  “Arya was already an established concept by the time Marici led the Solar tribes eastward of the Sindhu.  Linguistically, it simply means tiller of land.  It served to distinguish between those who ploughed the land and lived along rivers, as opposed to those living in the forests and mountains- Rakshasas, Gandharvas and Yakshas.  Over time, it gathered moral connotations- those who were noble and wise in actions were Arya.  And then Vaivasvat Manu gave us the official definition of Aryavarta itself- the land between the Vindhyachala mountains in the south and the Himalaya in the north- and all those living in it were the Aryas.”

	“Even the Rakshasas, Gandharvas and Yakshas?”  Sudasa asked.  

	Vasishtha chuckled wryly.  “No, not them,” he said.  “There was always a fundamental difference in their way of life and ours, and I do not think we can ever call them Arya.  They might not want that themselves.”

	“And what does Arya mean today?  Who owns it?  Why do we fight among ourselves, if we are part of one land?”

	Vasishtha looked at his pupil, feeling immense pride in Sudasa’s curiosity.  “Today, the title Arya belongs to any man or woman to subscribes to the Veda and its deities,” he said.  “It further extends to those on the fringes- ascetics and atheists who nevertheless follow the more esoteric of our ancient rituals.  Therefore it does not apply to Dasas- who have turned the whole Deva-Asura mythology upside down, nor to the Rakshasas, Gandharvas and Yakshas.”

	“And yet tribal fractures exist even within us,” Sudasa said.

	Vasishtha nodded sadly.  “Because blood and tribe run deeper than any bond, young Sudasa.  Family and tribe are the most basic components of our society- our very lives.  The Bharatas today are a large family, protected and served by hundreds who are not of their blood.  But this was not the case in the times of Ikshvaku and Pururava.  Save a few outsiders, all of Ikshvaku’s early cadres were formed from within the Solar tribes.  Maharshi Atri’s bloodline spread out to several branches both before and after him- and they were the ones who answered the early calls of Pururava, Ayu and Nahusha.”

	“But surely there were other tribes in their times as well?  Did they have no standing in the Kingdoms?”

	 Rshi Vasishtha smiled at his pupil.  “Once again you try to jump us ahead, young one.  I can tell you a fine tale about Ikshvaku and his rebel brothers- the other sons of Vaivasvat Manu.  But there is much more that happens in the Suryavanshi founder’s life before that.

**Year 38, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

“Back straight!” Barked Senapati Drishta.  “And point those toes forward!  Remember the golden rule, your toes should point in the same direction as the tip of your sword.”

How anyone could remember so many rules in the heat of battle, Pururava failed to understand.  But Ikshvaku had assured him that with adequate practice, they would become part of his instinct.  He had spent a major part of the last few months learning tactics and strategies, military divisions and formations under the stern tutelage of Senapati Drishta.

Bear-chested and red-eyed, the Senapati was a formidable man, shorter than Ikshvaku by a few fingers.  He was a native of Sakala, the Manu’s place of birth, and a fierce descendant of the Solar tribes.  Despite being well beyond middle age Drishta could best any man on the field, save Ikshvaku, who was his ward many years ago- just as Pururava was now.  Drishta loved talking about those days, when he was instructed by the Manu to prepare Ikshvaku for Kingship.  He talked fondly of Ikshvaku, clearly proud that the student had excelled the master in every field.

“The original fighting stances were designed by Manu himself,” Drishta once informed Pururava.  “Back in the day, when he still held a sword and had not yet fathered a son.”

Pururava tucked his toe inwards and straightened his back.  “Good,” Drishta said approvingly.  “Moving from stance to stance should be as fluid as breathing itself.”

Pururava whirled his sword around and pivoted, minding to keep his toes pointed in the right direction as he moved to the next stance.

“Good,” Drishta said again, though he did thrust his stick at Pururava’s spine to make it even straighter.  “Stand tall in front of your enemy,” he said, “So you may strike at him from above.”

The lesson continued till Pururava’s feet were chafed, and his arm hurt from swinging the sword around.  It left barely enough time for him to take another bath before lunch and enjoy a content nap.  Evenings were as exciting as the days, usually he would find Maharshi Vasishtha and sit with him till the night grew dark.  On days he was lucky, Ikshvaku would be around, and he could spend time with his uncle.  The latter happened only rarely though, for Ikshvaku was often away on campaigns against the Yakshas and Rakshasas.  In Avisari, Maharshi Vasishtha issued orders and made decisions in the King’s absence.  Pururava longed to accompany Ikshvaku on these campaigns, and the King would take him too, but for the fact that Ila had commanded her brother not to put her son in any real danger.  Under no circumstances was the boy to experience real battle till Ila felt he was of adequate age.  What that age was, she never specified, and so Pururava was left training in empty barracks each time the Suryavansha marched to war.  

Pururava found much admiration for Ikshvaku’s work ethic.  The King could easily choose to stay in Avisari- safe, warm and far from battle.  Instead, he led his men from the front.  “How will men sacrifice their lives for me,” Ikshvaku once explained to him, “if they see that I’m not ready to lay down my life for them?”

After six months of intensive battle training under Senapati Drishta, Pururava was told that it was time for him to take formal training under Maharshi Vasishtha.  He had already achieved familiarity with Vasishtha, having spent countless evenings with him.  But the official tutelage was quite different, and the amiable old man of the evenings earlier was replaced by a strict, demanding Maharshi.

Mornings started before the break of the sun, and Vasishtha would march a drowsy Pururava to the nearby stream for the morning ritual prayers, the Suryanamaskara.  The first time Pururava saw Vasishtha do it, he couldn’t figure out what the big deal was.  It was just a few sequences of stretching and bending, nothing more.  Surely he could manage that after months of training under Senapati Drishta.  He soon found how horribly wrong he was.  The full circle of sequences of just one Suryanamaskara left him breathless, and Vasishtha insisted on increasing the number by one every consequent day.  The Suryanamaskara was followed by another set of asanas, and he dreaded the Shavasana.  After the gruelling Suryanamaskara, the Shavasana was all that was required for him to fall into a deep sleep, something that Maharshi Vasishtha looked upon as an extreme sign of weakness.

Pururava had never seen anyone in his family conduct such exercises.  Maharshi Atri simply took a dip in the river in the mornings, and Pururava’s mother never showed any spiritual inclination.  Why did he have to do all this then?  He never even spotted Ikshvaku doing the Suryanamaskara, and the Sun was supposed to be his banner!  One day, he found the courage to point all this out to Vasishtha, who replied- “Ikshvaku is the King, he may do as he please.  You are my ward, my shishya.  You may do only as I please.”  Pururava found nothing to counter that with. 

Despite all that, he was having the time of his life in Avisari, and it was only with guilt that he thought of his mother- for he did not miss her as much as a loving son should.  Avisari was more alive and populated than anywhere Pururava had ever been.  There were markets here selling all sorts of stuff- beads, pots, pouches, figurines and much more.  He even found some tablets with strange figures carved onto them, and learnt from Vasishtha that it was a crude writing system- in vogue among the trading shrenis of the southern Sindhu and the ocean-states.  Capital of the Suryavansha Kingdom, Avisari attracted a wide mix of people.  There were tall and gaunt Ashvakas, bronze-haired and fair Sringaras, dark, burnt-skinned boatmen from the southern Sindhu, and even the odd few crannogs from the Yamuna.  The multi-ethnic and dynamic populace engaged in various sports and rituals that were completely alien to Pururava.  This was life here in its full bustling potential- unlike the sparsely populated lands around Plaksha.  

One morning, he returned from the day’s rituals with Maharshi Vasishtha to find commotion in the Rajalaya.  Soldiers were afoot everywhere, looking nervous and busy.  Then a few senior warriors entered through the Rajalaya’s gateway- bloody, scratched and looking fresh out of battle.  Finally, they were followed by Ikshvaku, who had sustained injuries of his own.  His horse was limping too, and there was a nasty scar running below its left eye.  Behind the King came Haryashva, and as Pururava was pushed to the side by the crowd, he saw a bound and tied figure walking in behind Haryashva.

Pururava jostled, trying to push his way back to the front again.  But by the time he got there, the convoy had passed through the main gate of the Rajalaya.  He sprinted towards the main hall, knowing that the King conducted his affairs from there.  A crowd had gathered inside, and Pururava recognized many prominent citizens of Avisari.  They whispered to each other, and he heard one say excitedly, “They’ve captured the Rakshasa leader!”

The murmurs and mutterings grew louder till the curtain behind the throne parted, and out stepped Ikshvaku.  The throne was carved out of a single piece of stone, and engraved with figurines made of purified bronze brought all the way from the southern Sindhu.  Plush cushions layered the seat, hand-rests and backrest, the latter sporting Suryavansha insignia- a red horse riding across a field of green with the Sun shining off its back in the background.  

The public entrance doors to the main hall were pushed wide open, and Haryashva stepped in with the bound captive.  At the main dais Ikshvaku took his throne, and Vasishtha sat down beside him.  Senapati Drishta stepped in after the prisoner, and when his gaze met Pururava’s, he gave him a curt nod.  The prisoner was the most hirsute man he had ever seen.  His arms and face were entirely black with dense covering of hair.  He sported furry bearskin, and a chain of random bone fragments hung proudly around his neck.  He walked with a limp, and his back was clearly injured- from the way he grimaced from time to time.  But his eyes were defiantly bloodshot and belligerent, and he showed no sign of fear.  Seeing him, Pururava finally realized why his mother had protected him from battle so far.  There was no way a boy like him could stand against a beast like that, training or no training.  Then guilt at his cowardice washed over him, and he glanced abashedly towards Ikshvaku.  The King was staring back at him, and at eye contact he gave him a faint, reassuring smile.  Haryashva led the Rakshasa up to a short distance away from the throne, and stood by his right while Senapati Drishta took the left.  Behind them, dozens of soldiers walked in and stood some distance away, hands on their swords.  This was clearly no ordinary prisoner they had captured.

“Rakshasa,” Ikshvaku said in a voice that boomed loud and clear across the hall, “Do you admit to being leader of the Kamyakvana Rakshasas?”  In response, the Rakshasa only growled and stared malevolently.

“No matter,” Ikshvaku said, “I know you are.  You were captured under the rules of battle.  By rights you are my prisoner, and I can have you executed.  But that is not my intent.  War is damaging to both our sides, Rakshasa, and a ceasefire is beneficial to both.  I have brought you here to my capital to negotiate a treaty between us.”

What was Ikshvaku doing, Pururava wondered.  The Rakshasas were vile and corrupt men without any honour.  What sort of treaty could be negotiated with them?  And hadn’t they already cleansed Kamyakvana?  The scattered Rakshasas left in the forest were considered a defeated lot, posing no threat to the boats that plied down the rivers.  Who was this Rakshasa then?  What sort of leader was he?  

Haryashva nudged the Rakshasa, urging him to respond to the King.  “There can be no treaty between us,” the Rakshasa replied in a hoarse, guttural voice.  His pronunciation was off, he enunciated where there was supposed to be none, and ate up the vowels that needed stressing.  Pururava realised that Sanskrit was not the man’s native tongue.   

“I understand,” Ikshvaku said.  “You are in a position of inferiority now, hardly the condition for a fair treaty.  So I ask you again, are you leader of the Rakshasas of Kamyakvana?  Say that you are, and I will treat you as an equal.”

The Rakshasa snorted in derision.  “I need not your friendship, Suryavanshi.”  He pronounced the title as if it was a curse.

Ikshvaku sighed and turned to Vasishtha.  “What is your name, Rakshasa?”  Vasishtha asked.

“I am Narantaka,” the Rakshasa replied.  “And yes, I am the leader of the Rakshasas in Kamyakvana.”  He spoke softer to Vasishtha.  The belligerence was there, but also a wisp of grudging respect.    

“Then meet me like a leader,” Ikshvaku said, “Not as the captive you are now.”

Narantaka looked at the King sullenly, his eyes speaking hate and suspicion.  “You killed my kind, drew me out of my home, and had me bound and tied by your men.  There is no way we can meet as equals now.  I am, as you say, a captive.  Treat me accordingly, King.”  Again, he pronounced the title as if spewing a curse.

“What you say only proves that the damage has been to both sides,” Ikshvaku parried.  “For decades, your people have prevented our boats from going through the forest, raiding and looting as you please.  You have stolen our cattle, metals and our women.  Do you deny this?”

Narantaka did not reply, and again Pururava wondered why Ikshvaku brought the Rakshasa to Avisari.  What sort of arrangement was he seeking?  “I’ll take your silence as an acceptance, Narantaka,” Ikshvaku said.  “And we can agree that both our sides are hurting, exactly the scenario that calls for a truce.”

“Don’t make a truce with this creature, Ikshvaku!”  A voice shouted from among the gathering.  “Kill him and be done with it!” 

Ikshvaku’s eyes found the source in a flash, whipping cold and hard, glaring at the offender.  The man quailed under his King’s steel gaze.  “I see only a man standing before me,” Ikshvaku said in a deeper baritone than his usual.  “A man as proud and stubborn as the Suryavanshi, it seems.”

Narantaka stared at Ikshvaku, suspicious of the unexpected compliment.  For the first time since he had been brought in, he stared around the hall, gathering its architecture and the people that stood in it.  His eyes lingered at Haryashva, and then moved to Vasishtha- where they lingered longer still.  “A glorious capital, Ashvaka guards, and a Maharshi guru,” he finally said, “You surround yourself well, King.”  This time there was no malevolent inflection when he pronounced the title.  

“I must,” Ikshvaku replied, “For I am charged with protecting my people.”

“As was I,” Narantaka said proudly, “But as my presence here indicates- I have failed in that responsibility.  You ask me to meet you as a leader, but I am a leader no more.  Already, another of my people would have assumed that title.  If I am to return to them now, they will kill me themselves.”

“Then stay here,” Ikshvaku said, “And give your strength to the Suryavanshi.  There is much we can learn from you.”

The Rakshasas eyes widened, and to everyone’s surprise he laughed- a hoarse, broken laugh that was cut short as Haryashva stubbed him with the back of his sword.  The Rakshasa coughed and spat out blood that fell deep red on the painted white floor.  “And what exactly is it,” he said between coughs, “that I can teach you, King?  Why will I do so, when you would only use it against my own people?”

“Bringing me to my first proposal,” Ikshvaku replied.  “Let us have a truce between us.  Your people may not allow you to join them again, disgraced as you are.  But surely you can act as an intermediary, and there may yet be peace.”

Narantaka did not reply, but Pururava saw from the look in his eyes that Ikshvaku had won.  There was no other choice for the Rakshasa, Ikshvaku would not let him out of Avisari on any other terms.  If he valued his life, he had to agree.  Pururava marvelled at his uncle’s acumen.  Despite all impulse, Ikshvaku had not killed the Rakshasa, but made an unwilling ally out of him.  This was the true stratagem of a King, not the brash reaction of a boy.  Pururava promised himself that this was a lesson he would not forget.  Later that night, over dinner, Ikshvaku explained his actions.

	“As the six horrible Deva-Asura wars have taught us,” Ikshvaku said, “War only breeds further war.  Each time Indra slew Vrtra, another took that name.  Each time Indra fell, another rose to claim that title.  And the wars went on.  I do not wish to start a cycle of war between Rakshasa and Suryavansha.”
