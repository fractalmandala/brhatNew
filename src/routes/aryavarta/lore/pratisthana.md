Pratishthana- The Foundation.  This was the glorious capital of King Pururava and his progeny, now descended to King Tamsu in the line of Puru.  Located at the eastern banks of the Confluence, the growing city was home to more than eight thousand people.  Several families traced their blood back to the oldest Lunar lines- many of which migrated south along the Ganga under the leadership of Ila- sister to the Manu.  Only Plaksha could boast of a more sincere Somavanshi lineage.  

	The Puru King Tamsu identified with bloodlines closer to his generation, however.  His was a world different than what faced Kings like Ayu, Nahusha and Yayati.  Yet the seeds of this current crisis were sown in their times.  Their continued aggravation of the Suryavansha was now returning to call upon its debt- and King Tamsu had to answer for the transgressions of his ancestors.  

	“Curse the line of Pravira!”  Dharmanetra spat out.  “It was Pravira who aided the Yadavas at the sack of Vitabhya, not Rudrashva!”  

	“The Suryavansha does not differentiate between Puru cousins,” King Tamsu muttered absently.  Stress was visible on his wrinkly, eighty-eight year old frame.  The crown should have passed to Dharmanetra a long time ago- and even the young Ilina was of Kingly age.  

	Dharmanetra growled in frustration.  “At this point, it is clear that Sindhudvipa has split his fleet in two,” he said.  “One half sails down the Yamuna, while the other comes by the Ganga.  They will merge just yojanas before Pratishthana.  I have set archers along both rivers, and they are prepared with oil-tipped arrows.  We will attack the Suryavanshi boats with flaming arrows even before they come close to the docks.”

	King Tamsu nodded in approval.  In truth, his mind was far too senile to grasp what his son said, but the King hid his failing faculties well.  He pulled out the paste of poppy with his shaking fingers and ingested a few pinches.

	Dharmanetra observed silently, veiling his disapproval.  He knew that King Tamsu was well past his time, but the illusion of protocol had to be maintained till the time was right.  After warding off this Suryavanshi attack, perhaps he could finally make his move for the throne.  “I’ve also placed some of our most powerful long-bows at the Citadel of Soma,” he informed his father.  “Those archers will spot the ships as soon as they are visible on the horizon, and their range will bring flames upon the ships long before they should expect them.”

	“Good, good,” said King Tamsu, bobbing his head up and down.  His finger began moving towards the paste again.

	“I shall keep you informed, father,” Dharmanetra said loudly.  “I have arranged for escape contingencies for the royal family.  There will be safe passage for you and the others out of the city, should that need arise.”  He saluted smartly and stormed off.  King Tamsu was already ingesting his next batch of the paste of poppy.

***

To his right, Sindhudvipa could spot the Yamuna wing of his fleet.  Their pace was faster than his, and they were almost at the Confluence.  Sindhudvipa frowned.  His instructions were explicit- both the wings had to close in on Pratishthana at equal pace.  What were those fools doing?

	“Send a cutter ahead and signal the Yamuna wing,” he commanded.  “Remind them that they must fall back in line with us.”  The assemblage of his fleet had been swift, and he drafted many men from the cavalry units to populate the Yamuna wing.  He did not wish for their inexperience to cause any damage now.  The cutter was off right away, and seeing it depart his father made way to the deck.

	“I should have been on the Yamuna flagship,” Ambarisha said. 

	“No, father,” Sindhudvipa said.  “From Pratishthana’s vantage point, the Yamuna wing will come into view first, even when we travel in line.  Any early moves the city makes will be directed towards the Yamuna wing.”  

	“Then we are setting those men up as bait?”

	“In a way, yes,” Sindhudvipa replied instantly.  His sharp nose and determined eyes mirrored those of his grandfather, and he inherited the same ruthless military mind.  He did not need to add that one wing or the other had to be bait in this siege.  Pratishthana was an old city, well used to passage and intrusion by river.  Its defenses were very likely to be unfamiliar to his fleet.

	Suddenly there was movement at the horizon, to their far-left.  Pratishthana was coming into view, and skyline was dominated by a large, red dome towards the river bank.  Sindhudvipa squinted and spotted three distinct flames light up above the dome.  His eyes widened in realization- these were long-distance bows.  “Send more cutters ahead!”  He barked instantly.  “Signal the Yamuna wing to stop and row back!  Stop and row back!”  

	“Set up the archer lines!”  Ambarisha shouted to the higher decks.  He spotted lines of Puru archers forming along the banks ahead of them.

	The Yamuna wing received its signal and began the slow, weary reversal of its direction.  Just then, the red dome fired its first arrow.  The large, flaming projectile swam cleanly through the air and landed directly at the wing’s flagship.  The flagship’s front end exploded in a fury of smoldering splinter and metal plates.  But a Suryavanshi flagship, however quickly constructed, was no mean beast of the water.  It held its flow and continued to back up, even as its front burned angrily.  

	Sindhudvipa frowned furiously, but then a wry smile formed upon his face.  The city of Pratishthana was going to put up a fight, one that might even test his fleet.  And no Suryavanshi scion was going to back away from a worthy fight.

***

The moon aided Pratishthana on the first night of its siege.  It swam between the clouds, and hid its light from Sindhudvipa’s ships.  Pratishthana ceased its volley of arrows once the ships moved out of their range.  For now the battle was at a hold, as both sides sought to assess the other’s next move.  

	At night, Sindhudvipa called his advisory council together.  He had a plan, but he needed to sharpen it with their critical wisdom.  “The bows at the red dome are large, strong weapons built solely for long range,” he said.  “They have a minimum range that we need to get beyond.  After that, their arrows will fall behind us and we can get into the city.”

	“We have yet to unleash our long-bows,” said Karmashva, his closest friend and commander of three ships.  “Just a little closer, and I know the city will be within their range.”

	“The long-bows are irrelevant as long as their red dome can keep hitting us,” said Ambarisha.  “Our first priority is to find a way to negate them.” 

	“How do we identify this minimum range?”  Asked Raunaka, Sindhudvipa’s second-in-command.  

	“There will be some sacrifice,” Sindhudvipa said without hesitation.  “We have to row swiftly, picking our moment when the wind is in our favor.  The Purus will fire, and some of their arrows may indeed hit our ships.  But at a fast pace we will soon be beyond that minimum range.  I suggest sending the cutters and rangers ahead of us.  Their small size will not interest the Puru long-bows, and we can get men into the city faster.”

	“It is a rash and risky proposition,” Ambarisha contested.  “Ploughing through to Pratishthana should not be the way.  There are lives on our ships that you cannot so callously consider forfeit.”

	“And the Puru archers along the banks will be hard nuisance for the cutters,” added Raunaka.  “This isn’t like Kushasthali, where we could surround the city from three sides with massive battleships.  The closer we move in, the more we throw ourselves open to its unknown defenses.  And there is only so much damage the flagships can take.”

	“Yet we have to make our way in,” said Karmashva firmly.  “Why do we forget that there is no other option for us?  There is no going back, no homes to return in retreat to.  We either take Pratishthana, or we die at its borders- forsaking thousands of Suryavanshi civilians whose lives depend on our success.  At the very least, we can keep the Puru forces tired and distracted till King Mandhatra and his men get here.”

	Karmashva’s argument got them stirred, and gone was the uncertainty from Raunaka’s eyes.  Sindhudvipa pressed his advantage.  “Men will disembark at either bank and sweep through the forest line.  But we have to take our chance against the long-bows.  Once we get closer, our flagships can target any spot in the city.”

	Sindhudvipa’s second-in-command nodded in assent.  Then the Senapati turned to his father.  Sindhudvipa’s title made him higher in authority at any war council, but no Suryavanshi son worked without the approval of his father.  Father and son exchanged silent words before, Ambarisha’s eyes blinked in agreement.  And so the sack of Pratishthana began a hundred and sixty-four years after King Prithu lost Vitabhya to the Yadava-Dasa-Puru alliance.

Every kill submerged Mandhatra in a fresh wave of exhilaration.  The spray of enemy blood upon his face invigorated him, making him feel more alive than ever before.  He grinned, snarled, cursed and even spat at the enemy- taunting the soldiers as he drained the Puru blood out of them.  His own men watched him with fascination.  Their ageing King moved faster than any of them, riding his horse like an unstoppable juggernaut of death.  The Suryavanshi elite guard cut a wide arc of burning destruction as it made its way to Pratishthana.  The rest of Mandhatra’s massive force was headed to Salibhavana, from where it would follow the Ganga till it reached the Puru capital.  Not a single man in the elite guard’s five hundred had lost his life, and their number included the King.  Battle trained to perfection, this exclusive group had another name in the Suryavanshi dialect- a name that struck fear in the heart of every other tribe in Aryavarta.

	“Aikshvakus!”  Mandhatra called to them now, his voice ringing out loud and clear across the field of death.  The men steered their stallions into concentric circles around their King, forming impenetrable rings that broke open and released arrows of men in all directions when in attack stance.  “Vinasana, Viratpuri, Upaplavya, Sakambari- these are the Puru cities we have sacked and laid bare.  But Pratishthana calls to us now!”

	He called for the men to ride to the Yamuna, and they would find crossing near the village of Yamaprastha.  Aikshvaku stallions were as purebred as their human mounts.  The ride to Yamaprastha’s opposing bank took them no more than half a day from Sakambari.  From his side of the river, Mandhatra spotted no Puru military presence at the village.  He sent two scouts ahead, who returned to confirm the observation.  Yamaprastha’s narrow, wooden bridge was close to two hundred years old- build under the aegis of Rajarshi Yati.  It was an ageing but proud relic of the Somavansha, and thus the Purus by extension.  Night was upon them by the time they crossed the bridge ten at a time, for it could hold no more weight than that.  

	Mandhatra was confident of his calculations.  He knew that the rest of his force would reach Krivi sometime during the night.  In the darkness of a cloudy sky he led the Aikshvakus to Krivi, setting the stallions at a relentless pace.  Their muscular, sweaty bodies gleamed under the moon’s pale night, shimmering across their hides as sinews and tissue furiously worked to obey their masters’ urgent demand.  The earth pounded beneath the horses’ strong hooves, beating rhythmically and sending wild beasts scurrying for yojanas away.  Mandhatra’s heart beat to the same rhythm, pumping strong Solar blood through his arteries and charging his adrenaline.  He felt the import of what was upon him, history would remember King Mandhatra as the man who destroyed the Puru line once and for all.  But when he finally arrived at Pratishthana two days later, King Mandhatra realized that the Puru were not going to die so easy.

“Spare nothing!  Give me all the details,” commanded Sravasta urgently.  Camped in the Naimisharanya some distance north of Pratishthana, he needed to assess the situation before riding his contingent in.

	“King Mandhatra, Crown Prince Ambarisha and the Senapati Sindhudvipa are all missing, my lord,” said Raunaka, second-in-command to Sindhudvipa.  “King Mandhatra was last seen leading the Aikshvakus to the royal docks, but the Purus have taken back that part of the city, and we have no new reports from there.  Crown Prince Ambarisha and Senapati Sindhudvipa were on the lead flagship when it went down to Puru longbows.  I have unconfirmed reports that they were spotted swimming to the bank and joining a cavalry unit.”

	Sravasta forced himself to concentrate on the battle, not his family.  “Give me the numbers, Mukhyapati Raunaka.  What is the status of our forces, and of the Purus’?”

	Mukhyapati Raunaka sighed heavily.  His face was greased with dirt and spatters of blood, and he had ridden to Sravasta’s camp from the heat of battle.  “Pratishthana has some very unique defenses, my lord,” he said.  “And they used tactics that we did not expect.”

	“Such as?”

	“At the time of our entry to Pratishthana, the Purus had stationed their best long-bows at the Citadel of Soma- the burning, red-domed structure visible from the tree tops here.  We correctly anticipated that the long-bows had a minimum range, and successfully took our fleet beyond that without harm.  What we did not account for, was the presence of more long-bows further away from the Confluence, hidden from our sight.  The Purus waited for our ships to come closer to the docks before firing the concealed long-bows.  More than a quarter of the fleet was lost in the first two waves.”

	“May Surya protect us!”  Cursed Sravasta.  “Did the lead flagship go down in that attack?”  If both Sindhudvipa and Ambarisha were lost so early in the battle, then the Suryavanshi forces were in trouble.

	“No,” Raunaka replied.  “Sindhudvipa valiantly led the rest of the fleet through the remaining volleys.  But it soon became clear that Pratishthana held multiple launching points for the long-bows.  Ship after ship went down while our long-bows returned the attack and successfully wiped out many of those platforms.”

	“What did Sindhudvipa do next?  And what of Mandhatra’s force?”

	“My lord, I must submit that the battle is still ongoing.  Even without our tactical errors, there is severe need of more soldiers.  While the Yadavas are staying away, the Anavas have sent a contingent of two thousand soldiers to bolster Pratishthana’s strength.”

	Sravasta checked himself before cursing at that as well.  Mukhyapati Raunaka was right- he needed to ride into Pratishthana right away.  “What mode of entry do you recommend, Mukhyapati?”

	“There are long-bow platforms at Pratishthana’s northern outskirts,” said Raunaka.  “The Purus have taken to firing on their own city- those blocks that have been taken over by our forces.  Our first priority has to be to negate the long-bows.  Only then can we bring some order back into our attack and reassemble our forces.”

	“Very well then,” Sravasta said decidedly.  “Take five hundred of my men along with the archers, Mukhyapati.  Attack the Puru long-bows and clear a way for the rest of my forces.  I will lead them to the royal docks first.  We must find the King and reorganize ourselves around the Aikshvakus.”

***

Sravasta found his brother in the Puru royal halls, staring down upon the Puru King Tamsu.  He could not decide who held more contempt upon his face- Mandhatra or Tamsu.  The aged Puru King was on his knees, surrounded by enemy soldiers, but his eyes were glazed with defiance.  “Where are the other members of the royal family?”  Mandhatra demanded of his lead Aikshvaku.

	“Crown Prince Dharmanetra is in custody and being brought here, my King,” the man replied.  “But his son Ilina has escaped with the women and his own infant.  We have sent men in pursuit.”

	“There is no time to waste,” Mandhatra said, turning to Sravasta.  “We will look for Ambarisha and Sindhudvipa later, first the royal line must be captured.”

	“And what of him?”  Sravasta asked, gesturing to King Tamsu.  The Puru Kings Bahugava and Ahimyati were dead, and Tamsu would complete that trinity.  

	“There is only one thing to be done,” Mandhatra said grimly.  It did not please him to slay royal blood so crudely, so casually.  But the fate of his tribe was at stake, and Mandhatra knew that there was no place for hesitation.  He walked up to Tamsu, who held his defiant expression till his very end.  In one clean motion, the Suryavanshi King unsheathed his sword and swiped it through the Puru King’s neck.  “Stay here and make Crown Prince Dharmanetra meet his fate,” Mandhatra said to Sravasta once Tamsu’s severed head stopped rolling.  “I will hunt down Ilina and his family.  Take lead of the forces, brother.  We need to consolidate our hold on the city-blocks, and the docks are the most important.”

	“The docks are already ours,” Sravasta replied.  “My men have seen to it.  But the city’s western areas are heavily concentrated with Puru and Anava warriors.  They have archers positioned at all roof-tops, cutting our lines of entry.  In Sindhudvipa’s absence the fleet is in a disarray, and we need to cut through Puru fortifications to rejoin our forces from this position.”

	“Do whatever is needed, brother,” Mandhatra said.  “But I will turn to nothing else before I have destroyed the Puru line.   That is the main threat before us as we establish a home here.”

***

“And that was the last time Sravasta saw his brother and King,” narrated Dilipa, pride heavy in his tone.  “King Mandhatra hunted Ilina down and slew him, but he could not kill Ilina’s two-month old son.”

	“Dushyanta,” said Sudasa, “Father to First King Bharata.”  He suddenly became aware of how a chasm of rivalry could exist between the Suryavansha and Bharatas, owing to the latter’s Puru ancestry.  If King Mandhatra’s aim was to wipe out the Puru line, then were a Bharatas not a reminder of that failure?  Aloud he asked, “What happened to King Mandhatra then?”

	“There are many theories to that,” said Dilipa.  “The most common one is that he died in battle.  While Tamsu and Dharmanetra were alive no more, the Purus still did rally together and defend their city most ferociously.  The Battle of Pratishthana remains the battle with the most Suryavanshi deaths ever- and our own records indicate that only two hundred Aikshvakus came out of it alive.”

	“But eventually Pratishthana was destroyed,” said Sudasa. 

	“Yes, but at what cost?”  Interjected Rshi Vasishtha.  “The city was left no fitter for Suryavansha than it remained for Puru, and it was reduced to blocks of warring tribes that found no peace for generations to come.”

	“What of the thousands of Suryavanshi civilians that followed Mandhatra to Vinasana?”  Sudasa asked.

	“They were saved by Sravasta, who established his own city of Sravasti at the mouth of the Sarayu,” said Dilipa.  

	“And what of Ambarisha and Sindhudvipa?  Did they too not make it out alive?”

	“Sindhudvipa did,” said Rshi Vasishtha, “But he could not save the life of his father.  The records say that he chose to spend the rest of his life in anonymity and shame.  His sack of Pratishthana was successful, in that the city was left ruined and smoldering.  But the damage to his own side was too high, too heavy for any honest Suryavanshi to claim victory.  It was not until his son Trsadasa grew to maturity that the prime Solar line would stake its claim again.”
