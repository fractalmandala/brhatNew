People in the future may well look at our Veda and see us as nothing more than Deva-worshipping, cattle-stealing nomads. Our knowledge will be decipherable only in the context of our history."

<cite>Rshi Markandeya to Maharshi Jamadagni</cite>

Markandeya blew lazily on the flute, making no attempt to produce anything of melody.  The flute emitted broken, hoarse sounds while he continued, oblivious to the annoyed look on his uncle’s face.

“Stop it, will you?”  Said Jamadagni, sounding as lazy as Markandeya’s flute.  It was a hot, dry day with absolutely no breeze.  Even the cows preferred to eat short and quick before the sun was fully up in the sky.  Now they rested beneath the trees as well, waiting for the heat of the day to pass by and the cool evening to arrive before heading back to the village.  Some of the older cows opted to lie in the pond, seemingly okay with the sun as long as there was water to submerge themselves in.  Jamadagni had waded in after them but emerged out just as quick, claiming with distaste that the water was hot and sludgy.  

Markandeya obliged and put his flute aside.  “Would you prefer I replace the flute with a sword again, Pitravya?”  He asked, using the orthodox Sanskrit title for an uncle.

“That will be easy for you,” said Jamadagni.  “I still have the limp.”

“By no one’s fault but yours,” replied Markandeya, idly throwing the flute at Jamadagni.  With a gap of less than ten years between them, theirs was not the typical uncle-nephew relationship.  Indeed, many mistook them for brothers.  

“Well, limp or not I can still beat you to the ground,” said Jamadagni.

“Smart move,” replied Markandeya, “making that challenge when I am in the laziest of moods.”

At that Jamadagni bolted up, favouring his right, good leg for weight.  

“Stop it, will you?”  Said Markandeya, mirroring his uncle’s earlier plea.  “Let’s leave it for the training ground.”  As an afterthought, he added, “When we build one.”

Jamadagni motioned for Markandeya to be silent, a frown upon his face.  Markandeya frowned too when he realized that his uncle was being serious.  He strained his ears and heard the sound of hooves in the distance.  He looked at Jamadagni.  For a moment the two stared at each other, their eyes meeting and comprehending together.  Then, in a flash Markandeya shot up and bounded towards the cows.  Jamadagni began climbing the tree, the limp in his leg forgotten.  

Markandeya roared and blared, pushing the indignant cows off the ground.  The ones in the water had already begun walking back, experience a part of them as much as it was a part of their two cowherds.  Watching them and still prodded by Markandeya’s stick, the other cows finally got in line and began reluctantly trudging back towards the village.  Markandeya pushed the last of them away and joined Jamadagni at the base of the tree.  Jamadagni handed him his sword and shield before arming his own.  The sound of hooves was unmistakable now, and pretty soon the five horsemen were visible.  Both tensed, the afternoon’s lethargy long gone from their bones.  They walked out confidently in the direction of the approaching horses.

As they approached, Markandeya’s attention went to the details.  The men’s approach was from the east- the direction of Bharatpura and Mathura.  The horses were old and slow, which meant that the men were not too high in any military ranking.  Their blades were without sheaths and there were no shields upon their backs, indicating that they were from the fringe, mercenary divisions of an army.  When they came closer Markandeya spotted their horses’ torn skins and scarred bodies- the beasts were clearly ones that were way past their retirement.  That is when the identity of the men became clear.  These were bandits, wild men who went from village to village raiding and taking their pick.  Untrained, predictable and rash men; and the two had taken on far worse.

Jamadagni put his hand out in a halting gesture as the men neared.  Markandeya stood beside his uncle, though it was the loyal bodyguard in him that now held his sword.  The men slowed their horses, annoyance clear on their faces.

“And who would you two be, foolishly standing in the path of approaching horses?”  Asked the lead man.

“Guards of Madhyamika,” Jamadagni replied confidently.  “And you need permission to pass.”

The men laughed mockingly, exchanging sneers among themselves.  “Madhyamika!”  Exclaimed the leader.  “Now that’s a name we haven’t heard before!  What town is this, cowherd?”

“It is a village,” Jamadagni said, “a village of cowherds and farmers.  And you need permission to pass.”

“Enough,” snapped the leader.  “Stand aside now, little man.  Or I will find your family first.”

Markandeya was about to leap in attack when another horseman shouted from behind.  “Wait!  I recognize these two!”

The other turned to face him, and he continued.  “They are the famed Anava warrior-cowherds, I have seen them at the battle of Mathura.”

“The Bhargava brothers!”  The leader exclaimed in recognition.  “There is a price on your head, my dear fools.  The Bharata King Pijavana will gift a hundred cows to anyone that slays you and brings your head- add to that your own herd of two hundred.”

“And the clan of Bhargava is said to own more than five hundred cows,” added another of the men.  Greed and confidence was visible on them, their cold and hollow eyes complementing the dry, bony state of their stallions.  The Sarasvati’s demise had displaced the inhabitants of countless villages- reducing their well-settled, prosperous lives to savage, apolitical nomadism.  Markandeya found himself pitying both men and the beasts.

“Ride away,” Jamadagni said, with warning in his tone.  “Madhyamika is not open to visitors at this time.”

“Maybe in a few months,” Markandeya added dryly.

There was a moment of hesitation in the leader’s eyes.  The ‘Bhargava brother’ legends were exaggerated and often untrue, but they did serve their purposes.  But then the leader’s ego and overconfidence got the better of him, and his expression turned into a menacing frown.  “I do not receive orders from cowherds!”  He raged as he charged his horse at Jamadagni.

Markandeya was in front of his uncle in an instant, his sword primed for attack.  As the charging leader closed in, Markandeya smoothly step aside and ducked to avoid the man’s swinging axe.  When he ducked, he swiped his sword upwards- piercing the galloping horse’s underbelly.  The horse’s motion snatched the sword out of his hand, and the beast roared in pain as it crumbled to the ground.  The other men swung into action by now, and Jamadagni was ready.  He threw his sword at one man and grabbed at the reins of another before he could charge.  While Markandeya slew the leader, Jamadagni dispossessed the others of their horses.  Then the Anava warrior-cowherds turned their fury to the remaining men together.  Self-trained and experienced by several years, their attack on the men was clinical and lethal.  Within moments they were the only ones left standing- the raiding men dead and their beasts either dead or chased away.  Jamadagni surveyed the blood around them with clear distaste.  He had hoped for the battle of Mathura to be his last time with the sword, yet he could help inflicting these nonchalant, mid-day deaths.  

Adrenaline surged in Markandeya’s eyes though, and he looked dissatisfied with his short, quick kills.  “More will come,” he said- his tone indicating that he was eager for it.

Jamadagni nodded gravely.  “Many more,” he said.  “We can deal with such bands of raiders easily, but soon we will find soldiers from Yadava and Druhyu armies passing by Madhyamika.  You and I will not be enough to fend them off, nephew.”

Markandeya knew that was true, but for the moment his bravado was the better of him.  “Let them come!”  He declared.  “I will slay each soldier of their army, but I will not let them lay their greed on our clan and its wealth.”

Jamadagni did not share his nephew’s enthusiasm, but he remained silent.  Madhyamika was not the place for their clan, and whether Markandeya liked it or not they would have to migrate from here soon.

“Markandeya idolizes you, you know this,” said Mrikandu, twenty-five years the elder.  “I have never frowned upon your violent ways, your proclivity for blood and death.  But I cannot have you steering my son down the same path, brother.”

There was no response Jamadagni could offer.  With the age gap between them, Mrikandu was more like a father to him than a brother.  It did not help that he did look like a mirror age of their father- down to the curl of his beard and the tenor of his voice.  

“They call you warrior-cowherds,” Mrikandu continued.  “I am told that the title is Bhargava brothers.  Bhargava- that is not a name to be sullied with killing and slaying, brother.  Descended from Maharshi Bhrigu, ours is a clan of rshis and cowherds.”

Jamadagni found some courage within him and replied, “Descended also from Anu, brother.  We are also Anavas- members of a warrior tribe that has protected fortresses like Girivraja and built great cities like Tamralipti.”

“A tribe that has abandoned and forgotten Aryavarta,” Mrikandu retorted.  “Though if one were not so kind, one would call it a tribe that was thrown out of Aryavarta.  Is that the family you wish to align our name with?”

Jamadagni bowed his head.  “I cannot argue with you, brother.  Your wisdom and your verdict are infallible.  And Markandeya is your son.  The path of the father is the path of the son.  I will consider it an offence on my part if I steered him away from that.  But on the matter of our Anava ancestors I cannot share your disdain.  You see the absence of the Anavas from Ganga and Yamuna as evidence of their weakness, their inability to keep a hold within Aryavarta.”

“What do you see, my brother?”

“Anu was given the eastern borders of Aryavarta as his territory,” Jamadagni replied.  “King Yayati wished for his sons to expand eastwards out of Aryavarta, not clamor and fight for its heart as the other tribes.  In our Anava ancestors I see the ultimate obedience to a father’s wishes, not cowardice and frailty.” 

***

“You are certain you want to do this?”  Durdama asked.  Dark skin, deep eyes and a hungry look on his face- his was the blood of Yadu and Haihaya.

Anga looked to his brothers, who nodded.  “We are certain,” he said.  “There is enough gold and prosperity to the east, and lands that would seem magical to any of us.”

“They say that the great sea is endless, that Aryavarta is the last piece of land before the Varuna Deva’s territory begins,” said Durdama.  At fifty-eight he was the King of the Haihaya Yadavas, ruling with an iron fist from the city of Mahismanti.  

Vanga chuckled without humor.  It was no secret that the Haihaya Yadavas actively violated as much of the Veda as they could, defiling the Devas in twisted but imaginative ways.  

 “They say a great many things,” said Odhra, of sallow skin and small eyes like his Anava brothers.  “But not all is true.  Our Anava forefathers have travelled to lands as far as where the Sun rises from- the great sea is verifiably finite.”  Of the six brothers it was Odhra who had grown into a leader, taking control of both his own town and the port city of Tamralipti.  

“While none of us here are known much for sentiment, I would think that Girivraja holds a special significance to the sons of Anu,” said Durdama.  History had not forgotten that when the King Yayati divided the kingdom among his sons, the black fortress of Girivraja was all that Anu inherited.  

“It would, but the special significance is beginning to cost us too much,” said Kalanga, youngest of the Anava brothers.  “The trade and gold lie east for us, and the Suryavanshi press down upon Girivraja.  Given the Haihayas’ traditional distaste for the Suryavansha, we thought you would be pleased to accept the offer.”

Durdama grinned and leaned back, rolling his eyes around the dark, dingy hall.  Girivraja was a half-broken outpost, inhabited entirely by soldiers of the Anava army.  Bound on the south by forest and in the north by the Ganga, it was an impregnable barrier carved into the mountains to protect the eastern borders of Aryavarta- a purpose it had long stopped trying to fulfill.

“Do I hate the Suryavansha so much that I would desire a wreck such as this?”  Durdama asked rhetorically.  “I must say, my dear cousins, that this does not smell good to me.  You know as well as I do that I have no quarrel with the men along the Sarayu who call themselves Suryavanshi.  The Suryavanshi have long been gone from my lands and are of no concern to my clan anymore.”  It was true enough.  With the end of the Sarasvati and Sindhu cities the Suryavanshi were no more to be found around Yadava and Haihaya lands.

Odhra leaned forward to bring his face into the light.  “When people compare the Haihayas to a pack of wolves, are these wolves not shrewd and intelligent?”

Durdama frowned and said in a warning tone, “Careful what you mean, cousin.”

“Careful what you mean, cousin,” said Pundra, the third youngest.  “A lone wolf should behave when among ghariyals.  Odhra merely means to make you see what you are clearly blind to.  The Suryavanshi of Sarayu may be of no concern to you today, but you can bet they will be snapping at you tomorrow.  Where else is there for them to go once they have the Sarayu and Gomati?  That is a dynasty hungry for conquest and notorious on legacy.  Soon they will turn to Ujjayani and Ekachakra.  And you must know the old saying- the Suryavansha never forgets, and it never forgives.”

“Still not my problem,” replied Durdama nonchalantly.  “The Haihaya Yadavas are south of the Vindhyachala.”

The brothers looked among each other exasperatedly.  Odhra said to the others, “We need not force Girivraja upon him.  Any of the other Yadavas would accept it, and so might the Purus of Hastinapura.”

Durdama laughed mockingly and slapped his hands on the table.  “Let us not play this game, cousins.  The Purus have lesser reason to take Girivraja than me, and of the Yadavas it is only the Haihayas that can hold this fortress.  Let us talk candidly.  You cannot hold Girivraja because the Suryavanshi press down from Vaishali and your strength lies further south on the Ganga.  Neither can you leave this fortress undefended, because if Girivraja falls your cities downstream are vulnerable.  Thus you need a strong force to do the job for you, and that strong force is mine.”  Durdama gave his Anava cousins a satisfied smile.

“Very well put,” accepted Anga, “but quite one-sided.  Tell me what you think of this perspective- You were forced to cross the Vindhyachala because there was no place in the Yadava Kingdom to accommodate you.  North of you is the Vindhyachala and everywhere else is endless forest.  You and your people have nowhere to go.  For years you have been trying to make a place for yourself in the Ganga-Yamuna plains, but the Grand Bharata Kingdom has thwarted you.  Finally when you heard of the Sarayu and free lands you thought that you could make your move, only to learn that the region was already claimed by none other than the Suryavansha.  This burns you, and it smears the reputation of the Haihayas.  You need an outpost to commence your attacks and force your way into Suryavanshi lands, and that outpost is Girivraja.”

Durdama’s easy smile vanished, replaced by a cold, hard stare.  “Do not make the mistake of presuming my motives,” he warned menacingly, “or I might decide to take Girivraja by force just for fun.”

`It was no idle threat, Durdama had done worse to people far closer to him than the sons of Anu.  But this was still the fortress of ghariyals, ruled together by the six powerful sons of the late King Bali.  They stood up together now, forming a threatening ring around Durdama.  “I warned you to watch what you say, cousin,” said Pundra, licking his teeth.  Next to him, his twin Suhma mirrored the expression.  There was a hungry, feral look in their eyes.

“One does not step into Girivraja and threaten the Anavas,” Suhma said in a false, singing voice.  It was a haunting, ominous melody.  Durdama had heard of it, it was the voice men heard when they were about to meet their death at the hands of an Anava.

***

“How would I know how many men?”  Vanga snapped.  “They’re just emerging out of the forest in droves.”

“Damn him!” Odhra cursed.  The Haihaya King Durdama had not come to Girivraja with a light force.  News of Durdama’s death spread fast across the fortress, and the few Haihaya soldiers inside died quick, vain deaths in their misguided attempts at duty and vengeance.  That would have been the end of it, but then the viewing outpost shouted out that warriors were emerging from the forest.  Hundreds of them were inside Girivraja now, aimlessly slashing and hacking through its caverns and dungeons.  Durdama had parked what seemed like an entire contingent in the forest around Girivraja.

“We must go, brother,” implored Anga, “Girivraja cannot be held, not today at least.”  All around them the sounds of battle and pain echoed through the galleries.  

“If we lose it today we lose it forever,” Odhra said.  “The Haihayas have overrun this place.  And they will not stop there, once they have Girivraja they will turn to Tamralipti and our Kingdoms.”

“And we must remain alive to defend them,” said Kalanga, “Girivraja is lost no matter what we do, you’ve said it yourself.  The Haihayas have overrun this place.”

“He’s right, brother,” agreed Pundra.  “The wolves outnumber the ghariyals today, and retreat would be the wiser thing to do.  Let us get out of here before the Haihayas reach this chamber.”

Odhra nodded, but his expression angry and defiant.  “I warned you that your games will get too ugly one day,” he said to Suhma.  He turned to the others, “His penchant for murder has lost us Girivraja.”

“Temporarily,” said Anga as he led them out.  “Let the Haihayas have it for now, it serves our purpose well.  Soon they will smell Suryavansha blood and turn north.”

Tamralipti. Confluence of Land and Water.  This was where the forces of Agni, Soma and Indra gave way to the might of Varuna.  From a great distance ashore his mighty statue was visible, gleaming gold in the day and silver at night.  Varuna stood tall and imposing, his shadow over the waters warning any malevolence to think twice before entering the port.  The statue’s left foot was placed over an equally menacing figure, the makara- great crocodile.  Its jaw was wide open, sharp teeth sticking out ready to snap, were the figure animate.  The makara was coated black and moss green, but its razor teeth gleamed as Varuna’s skin.  Together, Varuna and his makara guarded the Anava capital of Tamralipti.  

The city was accessible only by sea.  Travelers from Bharatvarsha had to sail down the Ganga and out to the ocean before curving back and arriving at Tamralipti’s port.  From all but its southern side the city was surrounded by dense and unexplored forest.  The Anava kings had never been lured by land as much as their cousins further east, it was open water and the golden lands beyond that they had coveted.  

The late King Bali once sat on the throne in Tamralipti.  Before him it was Dharmaratha, and Diviratha before him, and Rushadratha before that, all the way up several generations to Kalanara, the grandson of Anu.  Much like the Suryavanshi Princeling Sindhudvipa had sailed his fleet down the Sindhu and into the ocean, Kalanara had taken his people down the Ganga to wild, lost lands that none in Aryavarta had ever heard of.  He had returned more than twenty years later, both his father and grandfather having died of grief at the supposed loss of the family’s sole heir.  King Kalanara founded the city of Tamralipti and declared it the capital of the Naval Kingdom of the Anavas, but he did not live to see the completion of his grandest vision- the statue of Varuna and his makara.  

All that legacy and opportunity was Odhra’s now.  As King of Tamralipti he held the main Anava line, though the royal throne was now only a symbol of the old Anava Kings.  He gazed at the Varuna statue and felt the familiar wave of pride and sentiment overcome him.  This was his home, the land where his forefathers had forged the dynasty’s destiny.  That same destiny had fallen on his shoulders, but what had he done?  He lost Girivraja to wolves, fled like a coward and disgraced the name of Anu.  Anu had been younger than Odhra was now when he had carved Girivraja in a land infested with Rakshasas and other wild tribes.  What a man he must have been, Odhra often marveled to himself and his brothers. 

“We will get it back, brother,” said Anga solemnly, gazing at the Varuna statue too as their ship sailed towards the port.  “We will get Girivraja back and restore Anu’s name.”  

Odhra gave him a small nod, accepting the resolve.  Odhra shared a mother with Pundra and Suhma, while Anga, Vanga and Kalanga had each been born to different mothers.  But the twins had always gravitated towards each other, and Odhra formed company with Anga.  They even thought alike, often coming to the same decisions separately.  And what they thought was rarely similar to what the other brothers came up with.

“To what purpose?”  Kalanga asked, having walked up to them to stand by the ship’s starboard side.  “We have always said that our progress lies beyond Aryavarta’s coasts.  Why would you even want to get Girivraja back?”

Odhra chuckled without humour, well aware that save Anga none of the brothers held an attachment for Girivraja.  He could not explain to them why it mattered so dear, for how could one instill a sentiment in someone completely apathetic to it?  

Kalanga waited for a response before shrugging and walking away.  Odhra and Anga spent the remaining time in silence, as the shadow of Varuna grew larger and larger and the ship finally ported at Tamralipti.  In the silence between them the two agreed that the tribe of Anu would indeed move eastwards- they did not want Aryavarta if Aryavarta did not want them.
