> I see the way you treat people, the way you hold love for everything alive.  You are like no man I have ever met, and I have met many a kind in my time.  You cannot be of any tribe, of any one place; you are a friend to this entire world.<br><cite>Kanaka to his friend Kaushika</cite>

“With you, oh Soma Pavamana, our wise fathers conducted their affairs!”  Chanted Kanaka cheerily. 

	“We have drunk Soma and become immortal,” Kaushika replied happily.  “We have attained the light, the Gods discovered!”  Though there was no Soma in the Grand Bharata Kingdom, the Vedic hymns to Soma were meticulously preserved by the indices set out by Rshis Kanva and Medhatithi in their time.  The ancient, sacred plant was substituted by creepers, fragrant grasses and even leaves of the parna tree in the rituals of the Ganga and Yamuna.  But it was abundant here in Mulyasthana, available in every household much like the ancient hymns said it once was.  Kaushika learnt that the Soma plant preferred arid, dry climates- something the Ganga and Yamuna could not provide.  It grew in the mountains west of Mulyasthana, all across Dasa lands in the Haptahendu and over the mountains that now belonged to wild bands of Shakas, Dasas and Uttarkurus.  

	Kaushika gazed reverentially at the plant, its stalk ruddy and brown from the frequent dust storms around Mulyasthana.  He felt history with him again, Mulyasthana was once the town of Kashyapura- founded by Maharshi Kashyapa for the explicit purpose of exploring Soma.  He placed the stalks into the clay mortar, and picked up the ritual stones to grind and pestle them.  After three years of doing this every day, Kaushika’s hands were as skilled as any resident of Mulyasthana.  Kanaka smiled at the soft, popping sounds of the juice being squeezed out.  Kaushika continued grinding till the stalk was dry and fibrous.  Then he signalled for Kanaka to spread out the strainer.  

	Kanaka spread the thick strip of cloth over another, empty mortar.  Kaushika poured the juice out of the first mortar in a slow, steady stream with one hand and rubbed into the cloth with the other, draining the juice into the mortar below.  When the activity was done, Kanaka picked up the mortar full of Soma juice, but Kaushika carefully gathered together the dry stalk.  As always, he would save it and give it to the horses for feeding.  His years spent as a rshi notwithstanding, he had not lost his fondness for horses.

	The two headed out towards the praying hall, a large and serene place that was open from the above.  A large number of vedis were already alit, several rshi groups having started much earlier in the dawn.  Kaushika and Kanaka found an empty vedi and began laying out their ritual wares in preparation of the prayer.  

	“Do you not miss your land and people?”  Kanaka asked as they set up the altar.

	“No,” Kaushika said, truthfully.  He had turned his mind completely towards his new life, and the Kaushika of a few years ago already seemed like a distant memory.  

	They completed setting up the altar and wood, before pouring ghee over the arrangement and setting it on fire.  Once the vedi was lit, Kanaka began chanting the ancient mantras of his land in the local, Dasa dialect.  Kaushika was familiar with both the content and the dialect by now, and he joined in unison.  Their loud, booming voices gave the air a constant, deep hum.  Ritually, they poured the Soma into the fire and then into small cups meant for themselves.  As the dawn retreated and the bright rays of the Sun took over, they finished the Soma and immersed themselves in a trance of mantras and rituals.

	Mulyasthana, one of Aryavarta’s most ancient towns.  As Kashyapura it belonged to the Suryavansha, abandoned when King Prithu lost to the Dasas and Yadavas.  Then the Dasas took over and revived it, turning the desolate remains into a prominent, prosperous city.  Twenty thousand people called Mulyasthana their home, and at any given time there were two thousand tourists and traders making a temporary stop.  Dasa administration was nowhere near as efficient as that of Suryavansha, Bharata or any other Arya tribes.  As a result, Mulyasthana was one chaotic, unorganised city of haphazardly constructed residences and markets.  

	In Kanaka, Kaushika found a capable, wise partner for his prayers.  While he did miss Varman’s candid world view and Janmejaya’s open amity, the spiritual bond with Kanaka was what he was searching for all along.  When praying together, they often found themselves in the same alter-space, experiencing the same visions of Devas and Asuras at play.  This time however, Kaushika was all alone.  

Familiar with the temporal illusions that came with Soma, he accepted them with practiced ease.  He went several millennia into the future (or the past), where all the world coalesced into a single ocean of atoms, and lost himself in it.  Kaushika had a fleeting moment of sanity before colours and sounds consumed him, abstract fractals overwhelmed his perception and threatened to drive him insane.  On the borders of his sanity, he detected the vague wisps of something important, something he was meant to know and possess all along.  

Colours changed to visions, and visions changed to memories.  He saw the faces of his forefathers, the glorious Bharata Kings.  He saw battles being fought and thrones being built, fortresses being erected and chariots being wrung.  Then suddenly, he was back into his body, except this was not the body he knew and expected.  It was alien, one his consciousness had never inhabited before.  He felt it in the way the muscles reacted to his will, the way vision itself seemed different, as if he saw through someone else’s eyes and not his.  There were six others around him, all shimmering in a blue-white glow.  These were the companions of his common experience.  

Their outlines swam in and out of view, the borders milky and translucent like the Akasha Ganga.  He sensed that they waited for him to get his bearings, for him to recognise them and begin the proceedings.  One by one, he tried to discern them.

	Two of them looked alike, he saw it in the curve of their noses and the slant of their eyes.  Their auras too were of the same hue, and the shimmering patterns around them seemed strangely symmetrical.  Then it hit him, like a piece of knowledge instantaneously placed into his brain- they were named Bhardvaja and Gautama.  They smiled, as if they knew that now he recognised them.  He turned to the third, who looked at him with both pride and sadness.  There was a history between him and this figure, but it was only the name he could recall- Vasishtha.  The fourth figure was smiling widely, glowing amiably and welcoming him with twinkling eyes- Jamadagni.  The final two names came to him as soon as he turned to the fifth- Kashyapa and Atri.  Their auras were the most radiant, or perhaps the most potent.  Then a shell appeared inside his mind, moist and fragile.

	Unbidden, Kaushika knew that this was how the Veda was truly extracted- through random shells of coded memes that were unlocked only during deep, austere states of meditation.  The six figures around him moved closer, urging him to open it.  He did, and out came the entire knowledge of the past, present and future; of who and what he was.  It was like being plunged into an ocean, cold and piercing, to find that one was the ocean, potent and infinite.  In that ocean he felt the wave coming, and he knew what he had to do.

“So it is time,” he said to the six gathered around him.  He did not really speak though, for it was not words he uttered.  Instead, he sent out ripples in the ocean, and the others responded likewise.

“Yes,” Atri replied to him, and the others concurred.  

“And we are the Seven,” he said.

“Yes,” the others replied again.  He wasn’t really asking, and they weren’t really answering.  It was as if they were all saying the truth together, becoming part of the particular reality which held this Satya.  He knew that they had all done this before, but they would do this again as well.  

Then the ocean receded and he stood on the beach in physical form, even as his real body still meditated with Kanaka.  Only Vasishtha was with him now, and when he spoke it was speech he uttered, not Sanskrit but something more raw and primitive.

	“So you plan to wage a war against those of my name,” Vasishtha said simply, without emotion.  For emotion was not something that could be conveyed in this rudimentary combinations of sounds.

	“Some would say the war has always been on, and I am simply the latest warrior,” Kaushika replied, as emotionless as the other.

	“Yet that will not be your greatest calling, nor your last,” Vasishtha said enigmatically.  “Go now.”

Vasishtha raised his right hand and touched Kaushika in the middle of his temple with his forefinger.  Kaushika felt his consciousness journeying back towards his body.  It was a mark of how far he had travelled, that the journey took what seemed like an infinity.  In this time new and stranger visions came to him, and he was transported back to those fringes of sanity where he had glimpsed wisps of the truth, of Satya.  Then the fallout of the Soma retreat pushed him beyond the edge, and he found himself falling into intense blackness, pulled towards an unknown source by a force he could not understand.  He did not resist as he fell deeper and deeper, allowing the non-consciousness to overcome him and numb his sensation, his very sense of being.  

Then finally, when he lost all sense of self, of existence, the veil broke and he was snapped back into his body.  A split second before his consciousness re-entered its material vessel, the truth was revealed to him.  Devoid of a body for so long, his soul happily gulped in pranavayu, and took in the sensation as the air went in and circulated through his lungs.  Then, with the exhalation his lips parted, and the Gayatri Mantra was uttered for the first time.

“Aum Bhur Bhuvah Svah- Tat Savitur Varenyam.  Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi.  Dhiyo Yo Nah Prachodayat.”  Kaushika chanted.

**Year 64, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

Broken- that was how he felt.  Broken and lost.  Orphaned even; for Ikshvaku was like a father to him.  Ikshvaku, he said reverentially in his head. First King, Founder of the Solar Dynasty, Ashvatrasa, and Eldest Son of the Manu.  These were some of the titles he had acquired in his lifetime.  Some he inherited, most he claimed by virtue of his deeds.  Moisture came easily to Pururava’s eyes as he remembered the five glorious years he spent among the Suryavansha.  What he learnt in that time now allowed him to rule a dynasty of his own, with a capital that threatened to rival the glory of Avisari.  

	“What of the Princes, Vikukshi and Nimi?”  Pururava asked.

	“Prince Vikukshi rallied the Suryavanshi after King Ikshvaku’s death, and drove the Dasas back beyond the Sindhu.  Upon his return, he was crowned King,” informed the soldier.  

	Pururava heard in detail of how his Uncle died.  Now he wanted to know what happened after it.  “Tell me all,” he commanded.  “What did you see when you arrived upon Rajavasa?  How did you learn the truth?”

	Less than a week ago, Pururava’s western outpost at Vinasana sent news of a fierce battle at Rajavasa.  He dispatched a large contingent immediately, hoping to aid Ikshvaku in whatever was falling upon him this time.  In that time, reports came in from Plaksha as well, sending news of the Dasa attack at the Suryavanshi capital.

	“When we arrived at Rajavasa, the city was half destroyed, my King,” said the soldier.  “Its people were abandoning it, marching north to Avisari or south to Vitabhya.  They were being led by the younger Prince- Nimi, and he informed us that Crown Prince Vikukshi was chasing the Dasas back west, along with the rest of the Suryavanshi army.”

	Pururava clenched his jaw, feeling frustration at Ikshvaku’s stubbornness.  With Ikshvaku he enjoyed a genuine friendship that ran deeper than any blood-tie.  Pururava recalled Ikshvaku’s words, sagely said- The two dynasties must forge their own destinies.  And indeed, when Ikshvaku’s brothers rebelled against him, he did not turn to Pururava for help.  Pururava sent soldiers then as well, but Ikshvaku sent them back with the message- The dynasty of Pururava is as tied to my brothers as it is to me.  Let blood not fight blood more than it has to.  After he quelled that rebellion and exiled his brothers, Ikshvaku had added, I pray that your dynasty is never soiled by the sin of brothers killing brothers, my dear nephew.  And now Ikshvaku was no more.  

	“What did you do next?”  Pururava asked of the soldier.

	“We went in the direction of Crown Prince Vikukshi, intending to add to his strength as he fought the Dasas.  But when we came upon them they were returning victorious, having slain hundreds of Dasas while they attempted to cross the Sindhu.  The soldiers were singing, both in grief for their fallen King and in celebration of their glorious Crown Prince.”

	“What of Haryashva, what of Senapati Drishta?”

	“Both were heroes of the battle, my King.  The ferocity of Haryashva the Ashvaka was staggering to hear, he is said to have gone mad with rage after King Ikshvaku’s death, and decapitated countless Dasas.  Equally fearsome was Senapati Drishta, from what the Suryavanshi soldiers told us.  The land between Rajavasa and the Sindhu is littered with enough Dasa corpses as evidence of the fury and vengeance of the Suryavansha.  And even more corpses now bloody the river, decaying and rotting as it carries them downstream.”

	Pururava gritted his teeth, feeling guilty that he sat idly upon his throne in Pratisthana, while his Uncle and nephews warred against those foreigners.  Ikshvaku had named them Dasas- black and dark people.  To Pururava they were Mlecchas- pure barbarians.  His years with the Suryavansha had given him enough time to learn of the Mleccha ways, and he saw Narantaka with his own eyes as a young boy.  People counselled Ikshvaku not to trust that Rakshasa, but Ikshvaku tried to use friendship and reconciliation as a strategy.  Now it had come back to bite him.  

	“What did Vikukshi do next, and why were the people abandoning Rajavasa?”  Pururava asked.

	“The Suryavedi had died out, my King,” the soldier explained.  “The people were calling the city cursed, blaming the dark shadow of Kamyakvana.  And when Crown Prince Vikukshi returned and was crowned King by Rshi Vasishtha, he too declared Rajavasa a dead and cursed place.  He is shifting the capital south, to Vitabhya.”

	Pururava thought of his Uncle again, the great King who forged a mighty and powerful Kingdom.  People talked of Ikshvaku as a fierce warrior, a man who led from the front and was invincible in battle.  But there was more to the man.  Pururava had witnessed Ikshvaku behind the scenes, doing those things a King had to do, but was never glorified for.  Ikshvaku’s irrigation endeavours allowed for the settlement of several tribes, who were finally able to give up their nomadic ways.  He led the construction of wide highways, starting from Kapisa and down to Vitabhya.  He established trade ties with lands far west even beyond the Mlecchas, bringing prosperity to his people and finding newer markets for the potters, craftsmen, bead-makers and traders.  It was his patronage that kept independent towns like Trigarta and Madra safe from Yakshas, Gandharvas, Rakshasas and other wild tribes.   

	Pururava took a long, deep breath, feeling much older than his thirty-nine years.  Ikshvaku may be gone, but his shadow still loomed large over him.  The Suryavanshi King was a beacon, a standard and a mentor to him.  And just like Ikshvaku’s life had been condemned to battling Rakshasas and Mlecchas, Pururava had Gandharvas and Yakshas to contend with.

	If the mountains around Plaksha were littered with Gandharvas, then the dense forests around Pratisthana were positively bustling with them.  These forests, named Naimisharanya by the first settlers led by his mother, started from south of Ahikshetra, ran along on either side of the Gomati river, crossed south of the Ganga and ran densely till they reached the Vindhyachala mountains.  To both east and west of Pratisthana, the Naimisharanya was deep and uncharted.  It was home to swamps, marshes, numerous wild species, dangerous snakes and various tribes of Gandharvas.  Explorations revealed that the Naimisharanya ranged north till it touched the Himalaya, somewhere south-west of the Great Lakes.  That was the entry point for bands of Gandharvas to descend from the mountains and step into the forest.  And it was something Pururava could do nothing about.   

	His marriage to Urvashi won him loyal allies in the form of the Apsaras.  Theirs was a fierce, matriarchal tribe that was as vicious in battle as a pride of lionesses on the hunt.  And given their historical rivalry with the Gandharvas, Pururava found in them an ally that was as motivated as he was.  Perhaps Ikshvaku’s mistake was in showing leniency towards the Dasas, in allowing them the autonomy to prosper and rally against him.  Pururava would not make the same error with Gandharvas.

“Raise your sword to me, and we’ll see what I am fit for!”  Roared Pururava.

	Devapi raised his arms in a gesture of submission.  “I do not challenge your ability, my King.  I merely question the need to put yourself at risk.  Prince Ayu is of twenty-five years now, an appropriate age for the son to begin taking up the responsibilities of the father.”

	That Pururava agreed with, he knew the merit of real, bloody battle experience.  “Ayu can lead a contingent of his own, I do not doubt that.  But if the army of the Somavansha marches to battle, then its King shall be at the fore.”

	Devapi caught his King’s tone, and understood that there would be no further argument on the matter.  He wished his twin was here, together they could convince Pururava to sit this battle out.  But Ashvin was with Prince Ayu, far from Pratisthana.  He bowed his head and said, “As you command, my King.  I shall order that the royal stallion be prepared along with your armour, helmet and sword.”

***

His early days as a King were spent fighting Gandharvas in Khandakvana.  The forest of Khandakvana, which once seemed large and foreboding, was where he shed blood and sweat fighting them.  He thought he knew forests now, having battled in both Kamyakvana and Khandakvana. But Naimisharanya was another battleground altogether.  The trees were different here, casting strange shadows that made it difficult to detect movement.  Elephants, barasinghas, tigers, wolves and jackals aggressively guarded their territories- and among them were the Gandharva settlements.  Here in Naimisharanya, the Gandharvas made their homes atop the trees, twisting and curving branches to form entire pathways running through the large patches of settled trees.  Pururava and his men had to keep their eye on both- the surface to protect against the wild animals, and the tree branches to watch out for Gandharva settlements.  Snakes were abundant in Naimisharanya, and Pururava knew of no herbs that could help a victim of these varieties.  Three of his men had already been bitten, meeting quick but agonizing deaths.  They had to watch their steps at all times, yet if they moved too slow or stopped altogether, then mosquitoes would attack.  Pururava wondered how the Gandharvas could make a home out of a place like this.  

	The Apsaras taught him and his men elaborate hand gestures to use in the forest in lieu of words, and he saw the lead Apsara scout pause and gesture.  Pururava and his men stopped and crouched, straining their senses to detect what the Apsara spotted.  Mosquitoes buzzed around him, immediately settling on his hands and ankles.  Animal eyes glowed in the darkness, beyond the dancing flames of their torches.  Then the Apsara made another signal, and Pururava sheathed his sword, passing the torch to him.  The Apsara flung the torch in the air, and as it flew forward and landed in an arc, it briefly illuminated dozens of Gandharvas hanging from the trees.  The enemy was seen by all, and the lead Apsara did not need to make the signal for battle.  Pururava roared and charged forward, Devapi immediately by his side.  

	It was tough and dangerous battle, Pururava sensed that immediately.  When he swivelled to face the attacker behind him, it was out of fear and caution, not battle instinct.  When he slashed his sword, and risked glancing left as he did it, again it was the fear of something lunging from the darkness.  The few torches his men hastily stuck into the ground were kicked away and stomped off by the enemy, their dying flames giving faint light that only made shadows dance and cause further chaos.  He sensed an attack at every direction, a Gandharva swooping upon him at every step.  He turned to find Devapi, on alert for movement around him.  A shadow danced across his vision and he stuck his sword out, defending against an imagined projectile.  

	“It’s me,” Devapi hushed, finding him.  

	 “Any news of Ayu?”  Pururava asked.

	“His contingent was attacked by a smaller unit of Gandharvas, further north-east.  He was able to fend them off and move deeper into the forest.  Word has spread among the enemy that the Somavanshi army is on the march,” replied Devapi.

	Suddenly, a Gandharva came swooping down without warning, and Devapi was yanked up into the trees before Pururava could even react.  He slashed his sword in the darkness, throwing all training to the wind and feeling like a young, inexperienced boy all over again.  He heard a sound to his left and ducked instinctively.  As he ducked, he shifted his sword to his left hand and sliced it low and swift.  There was a loud shout of agony as the sword cut through a pair of Gandharva legs.  Satisfied with his hit, Pururava stood back up and thrust his sword up through the Gandharva’s body, tearing and splitting it along the vertical center.  His eyes were getting used to the darkness now, but it was a scene of complete confusion and chaos.  King Pururava knew that he had to get the situation back in control if his contingent had to venture deeper into the forest.

	Pururava roared loud and clear, uttering the battle cry of his dynasty.  “There is nothing in the world which is beyond the reach of our bravery!”  He shouted to his men in a voice that rang across the scene of battle.  “Get back in formation, and show the enemy that it fights the Somavansha!”

	The cry got his men charged, and they reverted to their training and formations.  Pururava had devised this this particular formation himself, given his many years of experience in fighting the exotic tribes inside forests and jungles.  He named it the Kashyapa formation, partly to honour the Maharshi, but mostly because that is what the formation looked like from above.  As its outer wall were ten men with their shields drawn, protecting the entire group like a tortoise’s shell.  From the center, men held out their swords, slicing and cutting at the enemy as the formation moved ahead.  Pururava himself remained outside these formations, guiding them and maintaining their discipline.  It made him more vulnerable to attack, but with several Kashyapa formations advancing, the Gandharvas had little time to turn their attention to the King regulating it all.  They kept attacking the formations, swinging down from the trees in huge arcs, trying to disarm the men of their shields.  

	But the formation was a renewable design.  If a shield was knocked out, the disarmed man rushed to the center with his sword, and swapped places with the swordsman.  The swordsman in turn placed his shield at the gap, and the formation was complete again.  Pururava stayed behind the formations, strategically cutting the tree-ropes of swinging Gandharvas that got past his men.  The Gandharvas fell to the ground in sickening thuds amid noises of crunching and grinding bones.  In this manner Pururava and his contingent advanced deeper into the forest, slowly finding the time to relight their torches and restore some sanity into the battle.  The Gandharvas were staying back now, unwilling to attack once the Somavansha established a solid defence against them.  But they were not retreating yet, and their eyes blazed with a hostility that Pururava had long ago learned to read.  This was a battle that was going to be long and hard.

***

“Why won’t they just give up?”  Crown Prince Ayu asked in frustration as he sliced his sword through yet another Gandharva.

	“I do not think that concept exists to them, Crown Prince,” replied Ashwin, ably swinging his sword alongside the son of his King.  “The Gandharvas do not know the meaning of retreat.”

	Ayu was not sure they were even fighting Gandharvas.  The enemy here was strong, wide boned and vicious- quite unlike the nimble, fleet-footed Gandharvas he knew.  He was sure that Ashvin wondered the same, but his father’s old friend did not mention this peculiarity, and so Ayu kept his mouth shut as well.  In any case, it was easier fighting this enemy than the typical Gandharvas.  These men came at them straight and hard- making it simpler to fight them within formation.  They were neither swinging in arcs from the trees, nor hiding in the shadows and branches.  Moreover, the sun had begun to rise and cast its rays between the trees, improving visibility in a forest that was otherwise humid and foggy.  The fighting had been going on for several hours, and an hour or two ago they received word that his father had managed to break the Gandharva ranks to the south-west, closer to Pratisthana.  If they kept this up, they could seriously dent the Gandharva territory and clear the area for yojanas around Pratisthana.

	Prince Ayu looked nothing like his father, having taken all his features from his Apsara mother- Urvashi.  It was only the grey in his eyes that attested to his Somavanshi inheritance.  His fair skin, thin hair and the softness in the bones behind his face were distinctly Apsara, resembling more the Gandharva facial type than the one found among the Somavansha and Suryavansha.  Yet when he moved with the sword in his hand, there was no doubt that this was a royal Somavanshi on the prowl.  His reflexes were perfect, his stance pure in technique and his sword lightning fast.  With Ashvin by his side, Ayu continued to cut deeper into the forest, chopping down attacking Gandharvas.

	After another hour of fighting, Ayu sensed a change in the environment.  Gandharvas were coming at them from behind as well now, but they were not charging at him.  Instead they ran right past and further into the jungle, instilling confusion among their larger counterparts that still kept attacking Ayu and his men.  There was a strange din coming at them from behind- like the sound of an approaching stampede.  Ayu focused his mind and kept his attention at the front, narrowing his gaze at another attacking Gandharva.  But before this one could get close, an arrow darted past Ayu and found its way straight into the Gandharva’s throat.  As the arrow went past, Ayu spotted the unmistakable glint of silver and grey- the royal Somavanshi colours.  He was already smiling by the time he turned around, and spotted his father’s Kashyapa formations making their way towards his line.  Behind them was a line of archers, continuously shooting arrows into the forest ahead of them.  A stray soldier ran forward and greeted Ayu.

	“I have a message from the King,” the soldier said without preamble.  He was obviously from Pururava’s personal contingent, given his age and the smartness of his armour.  “The Gandharvas are on the retreat, an opportunity that may not present itself again.”

	“I agree,” Ayu said, feeling flush with pride.  “What is my father’s command?”

	“We are to continue chasing the enemy,” the soldier replied, “Till we have cleared the banks of the Ganga and Gomati.  But your father requests your presence.  He has a special mission for you in mind.”

	“And what mission would that be?”  Ayu asked, unable to curb his curiosity.

	“The King Pururava would like your assistance in taming an elephant,” the soldier replied matter-of-factly.
