> Vivasvana was the first master of this art, though some contend that Maharshi Kashyapa was its real originator.

He is a Grand Master of combat, the First and most Glorious.<br><cite>Mukhyapati Yuyudha to Sudasa Bharata</cite>

“To truly tame an elephant, you must appeal to its intelligence- not its bestiality,” said Mukhyapati Yuyudha.  “An elephant needs to connect with you psychologically.  It needs to understand your world, and see your concerns as you do.  Only then will it respond to your call in the loud, chaotic heat of battle.”

	Mukhyapati Yuyudha was at the secondary rung of Suryavanshi military leaders, indicated by his title.  His long, dense beard had turned white at its ends, but his wavy hair was still black as a stallion’s hide.  His left cheek was mangled and torn, a permanent scar acquired in battle long ago.  It gave him a constant grimacing expression, one that turned into a fierce snarl when he bared his teeth.  

	Sudasa nodded, absorbing the knowledge as he patted a young calf’s trunk.  The calf swiped his hand away, bobbing its bulging head up, down and sideways as it examined itself in the polished, copper mirror.  “Look,” said Yuyudha, gesturing towards the calf.  “It is observing the paint on its head, recognizing that the reflection in the mirror is its own.  This is a faculty even horses do not possess- the ability to see themselves as they appear to the outside world.”

	Sudasa was fascinated.  He was well aware of the acuity of horses, having spent hours observing their silent language of hisses, snarls, and stamps.  He had seen horses face the mirror a few times, and there was none of the calm recognition in their eyes as there was in the young elephant’s.  

	“This is Pradyut’s first time in front of the mirror,” said Yuyudha, referring to the calf.  “And today, there is something else it must learn.”  Yuyudha gestured to the mahavat, who led Pradyut away.  “Come,” Yuyudha said, “Let us show you the lesson set up for him.”

	The Mukhyapati led Sudasa to a wide, circular field.  At the center was a complex looking mechanism, but as Sudasa got closer, he figured out the basic working.  It was a feeding tray for the elephants, and the two parallel ramps indicated that the tray could feed two at a time.  He could not understand the significance of the ropes though, or the levers.

	“It is a learning game,” Mukhyapati Yuyudha explained.  “The feeding tray folds back into its holding drawer, and the elephants must pull at the ropes to roll it out.  The trick is, the ropes they pull at are in fact the ends of a single rope.  They must pull at the ends together, else the rope will just fall out of its hook, and the tray will stay in.”

	Sudasa frowned and nodded, waiting to see the lesson in action.  Just then the mahavat led Pradyut and an adult elephant to the field.  Sudasa recognized the adult immediately- Rathi, the matriarch of Ayodhya’s royal elephant herd.  “Rathi knows and understands this game well,” Yuyudha informed him.  “She is also trained not to give any hints or signals to Pradyut.  He has to learn this for himself.  Watch what happens.”

	Rathi and Pradyut walked up the ramps to the platform, where the rope’s respective ends hung in front of them.  On the first attempt, Pradyut pulled at his end right away.  Rathi did nothing, and the rope came out completely at Pradyut’s end.  On the second attempt, Pradyut was hesitant, but Rathi picked up her end and waited patiently- the test was whether Pradyut would understand that he had to pull with her.  He didn’t, and so Rathi pulled at her end- to show him what happened if either of them tried to work this alone.  At the third attempt, the matriarch picked up her end and waited again, but this time Pradyut understood, and the elephants pulled together.  Now the rope got caught in its hook and sprung the tray out.  Pradyut emitted a cheerful hoot before enjoying his reward.  The mahavat gave him a few more runs through the ramp, changing his partners from time to time.  The young calf made no more mistakes, he had understood that the mechanism was something which needed two elephants to work in co-operation.

	“This is an important part of Pradyut’s training,” Mukhyapati Yuyudha said to Sudasa.  “The elephants must be taught to work with each other as much as with their human partners.  They need to recognize the scents, calls and paint-marks of their herd- so that in the heat of battle they do not get confused and crash against their own side.  The history of war is littered with stories where rampaging elephants from either side did utter damage and hardly any good.”

	Sudasa was awed.  “Elephants were tamed and militarized by the Somavansha, how is it that the Suryavansha possesses such deep knowledge into their training?”  He asked.  

	Mukhyapati Yuyudha smiled his best Suryavanshi condescending smile.  “My dear boy,” he said patronizingly.  “Even the great elephant Airavata was a gift to Indra from Surya.  There is knowledge of the pachydermic crafts in Solar blood from long before Lunar genes were even bred.”

“If Rshi Vasishtha omitted telling you of King Mandhatra, then he has done the Suryavansha a grave injustice,” said Rshi Vasishtha of his counterpart in Prayaga.  “Mandhatra remains one of the most resolute, powerful and important Kings the Suryavansha has ever produced.  By his time, the Suryavansha was no longer Aryavarta’s most powerful tribe.  That honour went to the united Pancha Gana- the five tribes fostered by Yayati’s sons.”

	“Yet they were but vultures trying to bite at a wounded, but not dying, lion,” added Crown Prince Dilipa.  Rshi Vasishtha nodded in agreement.  

	“Guruji’s lesson on Mandhatra was short,” Sudasa admitted.  “I only know that he was the King that destroyed the Puru tribe, and besieged Pratisthana by river.”

	“Pratisthana was besieged by Sindhudvipa- Mandhatra’s grandson,” Rshi Vasishtha corrected.  “And Mandhatra was also aided by his brother, Sravasta.  Dilipa, perhaps it is best if we share the whole tale with our young guest.”

**Year 414, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

There was a difference of four years between them, but one could be forgiven for mistaking them to be twins.  Only the lack of a dense beard differentiated Sravasta from his elder brother and the King- Mandhatra.  They even favored similar, dark skinned stallions bred from the same mother.  Indeed, the Suryavansha may have one King in name, but it was administered by two equally capable rulers.  

	“This alliance between Dasa and Druhyu does not bode well for us,” Mandhatra said, his sixty-eight year old voice husky and deep.  

	“But it does not come unexpected,” Sravasta replied.  “The Druhyus have been migrating west for decades, and by now the two bloods have blended much.  There would be many whose loyalties are shared between the Dasa and Druhyu.”

	“Is this Gandhara truly of the same line as Druhyu?”  Mandhatra asked, speaking of the Druhyus’ current ruler.  

	“There is no way of confirming,” Sravasta said.  “But more than four thousand Druhyus pledge allegiance to him, and the Dasas have given him land right in the middle of their nation.”

	“He has named the city after himself,” Mandhatra commented, and Sravasta nodded in confirmation.  “But does he have the support of Vitabhya?”  Mandhatra asked.

	“It would seem so,” Sravasta replied.  A tense quiver passed through the air when the brothers talked of Vitabhya.  The ancient Suryavanshi city now belonged to the Druhyu-Yadava alliance- a harsh reminder of the losses during King Prithu’s time.  The Suryavanshi capital was back at its first seat- Avisari; and Kapisa and Sringara were the only other cities the Suryavansha ruled over. 

	“Perhaps it is time to commence our own migration, brother,” Mandhatra whispered grimly.  “Our forefathers have long dreamt of this.  Ever since the Sarasvati began wavering its course and destroying entire towns.  For too long, we have defended the borders of Aryavarta to the benefit of all.  Now we must make our way to the heart of it.  This was the prime aspiration of both Marici and Ikshvaku.”

	Sravasta nodded in agreement.  The brothers were always of the same mind.  As young men, they were the left and right hands of King Yuvanashva, their father.  Both were grandfathers now, and Sindhudvipa was already a handsome princeling of twenty-three.  Sravasta had his own line, but the three cities they ruled over would soon be too small to accommodate them all.  They summoned Sindhudvipa now, eager to hear of his latest scouting campaign.  

	Other members of the royal family were called to council as well.  The forty-four year old crown prince, Ambarisha, was present along with his cousin, Vatsaka- son of Sravasta.  Vatsaka governed over Kapisa, and through his mother he was half-Ashvaka.  Crown Prince Ambarisha ruled at Sringara, and also maintained the outpost of Navapari at the Asikni river.  All were mighty men capable of being Kings, but it was Sindhudvipa who led Suryavanshi armies into battle.  He earned that position when, at the age of eighteen, he commanded his fleet down the Sindhu, across the Bay of Kutch, and attacked the Naga town of Kushasthali.  After that, Mandhatra titled him Sindhudvipa- Protector of the Sindhu.

	“The waters of Shatadru and Sarasvati mingle freely,” Sindhudvipa told them.  “Their courses intersect at various points through the marshes.  Kashyapura, Harayupa, Sakala, Prasthala- none of these towns remain, and there is no population to be found.  The Puru borders begin at Vinasana- capital of King Bahugava.”

	“And what of Plaksha?”  King Mandhatra asked.  His deep, aged eyes boring through his grandson.  

	“Plaksha is manned by forces under King Ahimyati,” Sindhudvipa said.

	“Then the Puru Kingdom has in fact two borders,” Mandhatra said, “And we must strike at both simultaneously.”

	“So that is what this is,” said Crown Prince Ambarisha, as realization dawned upon him.  “A War Council- we are marching to battle.”

	Sravasta nodded at his nephew.  “The final march, in a manner of speaking,” he said.  “The Purus are weaker than they ever have been.  Vinasana is constantly under pressure from the Sarasvati, and Pratisthana grows soft in its secure position.  The time is right for the Suryavansha to claim its share of Aryavarta.  Let Druhyus and Turvasas deal with its borders, as their forefathers intended for them to.”

***

A total of eleven thousand men were gathered in the tents around Navapari- all fierce and loyal soldiers of the Suryavanshi army.  This was a momentous, unique moment in their lives.  For the first time, they waded into war not by leaving their families and homes behind, but by taking them along.  The Suryavansha now marched like the Solar tribes of old- completely nomadic, and with all possessions in tow.  Kapisa and Avisari were left to the Ashvakas, and King Mandhatra’s parting words to them were- “The annals of Aryavarta have always seen Ashvakas at the fringes.  Never a part of it, neither an outsider.  Yet you have been content with such, and have given undying loyalty to us for centuries.  Now, it is time for us to bid farewell- for even Surya and the Ashvins were not together forever.  Avisari, the home of my forefathers, I give to you.  These lands have always been yours, and we were but guests.  May you make a great nation of it, a land as proud and glorious as your mighty tribe!”

	Sringara remained under King Mandhatra, and Vatsaka would govern it in his stead.  For now, the King and his advisors huddled around their map of Aryavarta- a large, heavy tablet of clay, with deep lines and symbols carved onto it.  Rivers were clearly marked, and everyone present recognized each line for the river it represented.  A small icon of the Sun, carved within a square across what was the River Asikni, was the reference for Navapari- their current location.  Other distinct shapes stood for Puru, Yadava, Druhyu, Dasa and Turvasa cities.  

	The King held a long, wooden pointer in his hand, and at his signal the Senapati placed tiny figurines on the map.  Five elephant figures were placed, for the five hundred elephants camped around Navapari.  Fourteen horses- for the seven thousand cavalry units, two figures of a man with a bow- for the thousand archers, and four sword-men- for two thousand infantry units.  A larger, more intricately sculpted horse was placed as well- the five hundred men in King Mandhatra’s royal guard.  Lastly, three crowns represented the three Suryavanshi war commanders- Mandhatra, Sravasta, and Sindhudvipa.  

	King Mandhatra surveyed the impressive array of battle units placed on his map, and nodded in approval.  “Place the estimated number of enemy units now,” he said imperiously.  A veteran of countless battles, he could assess the courses of any conflict by observing the initial placement of troops.    

	Senapati Sindhudvipa proceeded to place two thousand battle units at Plaksha, a thousand at Ahikshetra, a further two thousand at Vinasana and four thousand at Pratisthana.  This was the combined Puru army- including two-thousand war elephants, and two thousand horses imported from Druhyu lands.  At Mandhatra’s signal, he placed estimated units for Yadavas and Druhyus- a further three thousand men for them to possibly contend with.  

	The battle-field now set, Mandhatra began moving the pieces around with his pointer.  “We will split the army into three sets,” he said, while moving the pieces accordingly.  “Two sets, led by Sravasta and Sindhudvipa, will make their way to Plaksha.  The city is culturally and historically significant to the Purus.  Any attack on them must commence with an attack on their morale.  I will lead the third set to Vinasana.”  Mandhatra separated two hundred elephants, four and a half thousand of the cavalry, and the royal guard horse, and placed them between Navapari and Vinasana.  

	“Sindhudvipa,” said Sravasta, “You and I will attack Plaksha together, and we will secure the land between Sarasvati and Yamuna.  Then, you will get the opportunity to display your naval prowess once again.”

	To indicate this, Mandhatra moved Sravasta’s sets between Plaksha and Ahikshetra, and placed Sindhudvipa’s sets on the line that represented the Yamuna.  “When we attack Vinasana and Plaksha, the first thing the Purus will do is send word to Pratisthana,” Mandhatra said.  “But there is little King Tamsu can do.  Even if our estimates are conservative, he can muster only a maximum of six thousand soldiers.  This is not enough for our combined pressure, provided that Pratisthana is attacked by both land and river.”

	Sindhudvipa’s eyes lit up in understanding.  “I am to lead a fleet down the Yamuna,” he said.  “But such a journey will take time.  The men will have to chop wood and build boats, not to mention resist attacks from smaller contingents of the Puru army that will ride in from Makarandi, Salibhavana or Vrukasthali.”

	“This is where I step in, my son,” said Crown Prince Ambarisha.  “After running through Vinasana, I will ride hard to you with two thousand horsemen.  We will be your defense while you construct the attacking fleet.  Father will establish a defense-post at Vinasana, and then continue to Pratisthana- where he will arrive in time to aid your attack.  His wide, flanking route will also scout for any help the Yadavas or Druhyus may seek to send the Purus’ way.”

	“I will take the remaining men to Ahikshetra,” added Sravasta.  “And neutralize the threat from King Ahimyati.  We will all converge our forces at Pratisthana.”

	“If all goes to plan, we will bring a force of more than eight thousand men at Tamsu’s doorstep,” declared King Mandhatra confidently.

***

“I am not convinced of the purpose to our madness, Grand-Uncle,” admitted Sindhudvipa, deep creases of concern appearing on his young forehead.  “There is no plan for what happens after our attack, after our war.  What about the children, women and elderly with us?  When we have sacked the Puru cities and ousted their inhabitants, will we rebuild them into homes for our people?  And how many years will have to pass before these new homes are safe and stable?” 

	Sravasta put a reassuring hand on his grand-nephew’s shoulder.  “Your grandfather is not ignorant of these concerns, Sindhudvipa,” he said.  “You must understand that there is a vital distinction between a Puru and a Puru subject.  In the six generations since King Puru, his tribe has swollen to more than four thousand- a simple progression, once you assume four progeny to every individual.  Yet the non-Puru subjects in the Puru Kingdoms far outnumber those of Puru family lines, and these are the people that populate their cities.  Their tribes owe no particular allegiance to Puru blood- many of them are in fact off-shoots of early Solar tribes, or others that migrated with them.”

	“And these people will accept us willingly?  They will make space for us and share their rivers with us?”  Sindhudvipa’s tone made it clear that he was skeptical.  He was a product of harsh Suryavanshi training that commenced at the age of seven.  Conditioned to obey the command of his superiors, he bore the added pressure of being grandson to the King.  Their formal, terse relationship did not allow for him to challenge the King’s opinion- at least not in his presence.  He could be free with his mind in front of Sravasta though.

	“Bhalana, Chedi, Krivi, Vibhindu and Yakshu,” Sravasta listed aloud.  “These are some of the tribes that have made their homes in lands that are ruled by Puru.  Most of them are those that migrated to the Ganga-Yamuna during the times of King Prithu.  They have not forgotten the glory and dignity of the Suryavansha, nor have they overlooked the treachery of the Purus.  These tribes seek peace and stability, young Sindhudvipa.  It does not matter to them who calls himself King- but they will certainly welcome the descendants of Kings Anena and Prithu.”

	“And will our people accept them?”  Sindhudvipa challenged.  “Will our people be able to drink the waters of Ganga and Yamuna, when for generations they have prayed to Sindhu and Sarasvati?  Will our horses and cattle settle into the air and soil of these lands?”

	“None of your concerns are invalid,” admitted Sravasta, “But you speak as if there are other options available to us.  The north is lost, you know that as well as I do.  With the Dasa-Druhyu alliance pressing in from the west, and the Pramshu-Turvasas lying just north of us, we cannot protect our three cities for long.  At some point we have to break in-land into Aryavarta.  And do you think that the time is not right for that?  The Sarasvati’s unpredictable course has made the Purus more vulnerable than ever, and we may not find ourselves in such favoring circumstances again.  Our tribe numbers more than twenty thousand- where will you settle these growing numbers?”

***

Five hundred horsemen were assigned with the task of protecting and leading seven thousand Suryavanshi citizens, behind Mandhatra’s advance party.  The rest were back in Navapari, Sringara and Avisari- they would be led by Vatsaka once Pratisthana was destroyed, and the tribe had carved its place among the Ganga and Yamuna.  King Mandhatra’s steely expression and determined eyes did not betray the whirls of concern within his mind.  He knew the magnitude of the decisions he had taken.  His actions could either break his tribe forever, or change its destiny for the best, once and for all.  If he failed, history would look upon him as the man who ended the line of Ikshvaku, Puranjaya and Prithu.  He would be the one who destroyed Marici’s dream.

	The ride from Navapari to Vinasana would take around two weeks.  Mandhatra knew that they could make the journey in less than ten days, but with seven thousand citizens following, he did not want to set too harsh a pace.  They also had to cross the Iravati and Shatadru rivers, passing right through the lands that were once home to Sakala and Prasthala.  He did not have the luxury of building boats- that would waste too much time.  Instead he sent advance scouts ahead, instructing them to search for shallow spots in the rivers where men and horses could cross.  

	After around a week of riding, the tail of people following Mandhatra’s party extended all the way between Iravati and Shatadru.  His explicit instructions were that the people follow in a straight line, not in groups and clumps that could be easy targets for archers or other organized attacks.  Once he crossed the Shatadru, nothing but flat, barren land separated him and Vinasana.  Here he waited for the end of the line to join him.

	“We will set a quick pace to Vinasana now, I want momentum to be on our side when we reach the city,” Mandhatra said to his son.  “You will lead the non-combatants with one thousand horsemen, but I do not want you to follow us.”

	Ambarisha frowned.  Father had the annoying habit of changing plans at the last moment.  “What do you want us to do then?”

	“The raid at Vinasana will not escape the attention of Yadavas at Puskara,” Mandhatra explained.  “And I do not want our civilians to be caught in the midst of an inter-tribal warzone.  Instead, you will cut through Khandakvana and make way for the south of Plaksha- where you will meet up with Sravasta and Sindhudvipa.”

	“Eight thousand people wading their way through the forest,” Ambarisha said, with doubt in his tone, “Not all of them will make it out alive, father.  The forest is dense and full of predators and Rakshasas- and my thousand horsemen will not be able to maintain our perimeter around the civilians.”

	“I know,” Mandhatra accepted.  “But the alternative is to lead these people to Vinasana and war.  I cannot depend upon the honour of Puru or Yadava, my son.  I cannot assume that they will leave the civilians unharmed, once we descend upon them with our full force.  This is a risk we have to take.”

	“Uncle Sravasta would have disagreed, wouldn’t he?”  Ambarisha said.  “That is why you did not bring this up at Navapari.”

	“Yes,” Mandhatra admitted.  “Sravasta does not like risk and unpredictability.  He would have preferred the known dangers at Vinasana to the unknown dangers in Khandakvana.  But I am the King, and I wished to avoid the unnecessary debate that would have come up at Navapari.  When this campaign is over, he can have a Kingdom of his own and do as he likes.”

	“Very well,” Ambarisha said.  He was not used to disagreeing with his father, and the King’s word was law to any Suryavanshi.  “Why don’t you begin the ride to Vinasana then?  I will wait here for the tail of the line to cross the Shatadru, and then head for Khandakvana.  This is good, father.  I will chart a route through the old city of Madra.  It may be abandoned now, but I believe we will find useful metals and weapons in its ruins.”

	“Excellent,” Mandhatra said.  He intended the same, but he wanted to see whether Ambarisha would think of it as well.  At sixty-eight, Mandhatra knew that his time as a King was coming to a close.  Yet, he was undecided on whether the throne should pass to his son, or his grandson.  Among the people, Sindhudvipa was undoubtedly more popular.  But Ambarisha was the rightful Crown Prince.  This campaign was their test, and at Pratisthana he would decide who was to be the King.
