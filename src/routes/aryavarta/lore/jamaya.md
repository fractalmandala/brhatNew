“Asmanjasa and Amshumanta were not the only sons King Sagara had,” said Dilipa knowingly.  “The scribes in Ayodhya have detailed records of thirteen more sons and nineteen daughters from his two queens alone.  Then there were countless others from his many short-lived affairs.  So much so, that by my father’s generation there were more than eight hundred Suryavanshi descended from Sagara alone- you would not assume such a population burst among a tribe displaced and exiled.  In any case, the number was enough for the bards to sing that Bhagiratha returned with thousands of sons of Sagara.”

	“Is it acceptable for a Suryavanshi King to have affairs outside his marriages?”  Sudasa asked.

	“Don’t be naïve, Sudasa,” Dilipa said, somewhat rudely.  “Our tribes would be small indeed, were it not for the affairs of our Kings.  How else do you think the Bharata and Suryavansha number in thousands?”

	Sudasa pressed his lips, forehead creased in thought.  They continued to tiptoe along the brick wall, knocking tree branches away with their sticks.  Dilipa made his way with a bored ease, but Sudasa swayed sideways time to time as he maintained his balance.  The brick wall formed a perimeter around one of Kashi’s oldest temples, built in the time of King Kasha.  This late in the night, the temple was closed to visitors, but that did not deter this group of boys.  There were eight of them in all- Dilipa, Sudasa, Devaratha, Riksashva, Svarnaromana, Kapila, Dridhu and Yavinara.  Riksa and Svarna were cousins to Dilipa, while the rest were cousins to Sudasa and Devaratha.  The six year old Mitrayu had not been brought along for this particular excursion.

	The temple’s front façade led to the river bank, and a thick clump of trees separated its back-garden and the outer wall.  “You are sure that the granary will be at the corner?”  Dilipa asked.

	“It is the classic temple design of Kashi,” Sudasa replied, his voice faltering as he swayed.  “The granary has to be at the north-east corner of the compound.”

	“And the granary will have the brew?”  Devaratha asked from behind.  

	“It better!”  Commented Svarnaromana from further afar.  

	“We can push Sudasa into the well, if it doesn’t,” said Dridhu.  “That issureto be close to the river bank.”  

	The boys continued to slink through the branches, cautiously making their way across the thin wall.  On one occasion, Devaratha almost fell towards the outer side, but he used a branch to hold on and bring himself back to balance.  At the north-east corner the granary stood as promised, a single ghee-lamp illuminating its outline.  Dilipa stopped and so did the others behind him.  “Wait here,” he said.  “I’ll go and look around.  Let me make sure no one is awake.”  Pointing to Sudasa and Riksashva he said, “When I give the call, you two join me at the granary entrance.  The rest of you, wait here and make sure no one comes investigating.”

	Dilipa leaped off the wall and landed softly on the dirt.  Then he disappeared into the darkness, his silhouette flashing by a little later near the granary’s ghee-lamp.  After some waiting they heard four, deliberate croaks.  “Let’s go,” Riksashva said.  

	They crept through the darkness towards the granary, Dilipa’s outline visible at the entrance.  At their arrival, Dilipa nodded and they went it.  Kashi was a city largely free of robbery, murder and other crimes.  There was no lock on door at the granary, which was good- because any attempts to pry their way through could have attracted attention.  There was another lamp at the far corner inside, casting shadows on assorted sacks of grain and tall, slender vats of fermented wheat and barley.  Dilipa opened their lids and smelled them with expertise, commenting on their ages and trying to decide which one to steal from.  He finally stopped at the fifth vat, and commented after smelling its contents, “This is the one.  It is at least fifteen years old.”  He dipped his finger in and licked it to taste the brew, smiling in approval after he did so.

	Sudasa handed Riksashva a leather pouch, and helped Dilipa pour some brew into it.  They made sure not to spill some on the ground.  Then Riksashva tightened the cords around it and they left as silently as they came, putting the vat back in the exact same position they found it.  The others were waiting excitedly, and they wasted no time in moving themselves far away from the temple premises.  Then they found a dark, sandy part of the river-bank and passed the brew among themselves.

	“That sister of yours,” said Dilipa, “Vandana.  How old is she?”

	“Sixteen,” Devaratha replied.  

	“I intend to ask for her hand in marriage in a few years,” Dilipa said. “My father keeps insisting that we must form closer marital ties with the Bharatas.”

	“My father would agree,” Sudasa said, “But King Vishvaratha might be differently inclined.  The line of Jahnu has never married outside Bharata blood.”

	“Which is why I think we must look at other ways to bring us closer,” Dilipa said, a touch of Suryavanshi hauteur to his tone.  “There was an ancient tradition once, between the Solar and Lunar dynasties.  Somavanshi princes would spend five years of training under the Suryavansha. It started with Pururava and went on till Nahusha’s time.”  Dilipa turned his eyes to Sudasa and said, “We can begin that custom anew.  I have already suggested to my father that we invite you to do the same with us.”

	Sudasa’s eyes widened in excitement.  “I know of the tradition!  And my military training is set to begin soon anyway.  But I cannot make any decisions here, my father’s word will be supreme.”

	“But what about me?”  Asked Devaratha.

	“Or us?”  Asked Dridhu, Kapila and Yavinara nodding beside him.  

	Dilipa chuckled.  “I do not think the Bharatas would willingly sendalltheir princes to Ayodhya!  Maybe one day we become so close that there are no distinguishing lines between us.  But for now, an accord between the prime lines of our dynasties must suffice.”  Then he turned to Sudasa again.  “And you are right to defer to your father’s decision, but your wishes matter as well.  It will not do to have an unwilling student, sent only on his father’s bidding.”

	“I am ready,” Sudasa said without hesitation, his thoughts going to the Aikshvaku warriors of Ayodhya.  How could any warrior decline the opportunity to train among such fighters?

**Year 53, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

Aum.  It reverberated through him, and he vibrated with it.  The original syllable was two discernible elements- the asleep and the awake.  He found a further split, and now Aum was three.  The first was the initial guttural ring it began with- the wakeful.  The second was the middle sustained sound, the sound of contentment- the dreaming sleep.  The last was the nasal end that hummed from within- the dreamless sleep.  Father had approved of this revelation, his eyes glimmering with pride.  On that day, the distinction between guru and shishya disappeared.  They were equals now, on the journey to spiritual culmination.

	“Next, Guruji?”  Asked Nimi, younger son of King Ikshvaku.

 	Vasishtha smiled.  They all knew who came next, but were choosing to play the part of obedient students on this morning.  “Next is Nabhaga, third son of the Manu,” Vasishtha said.  “After him, the other sons are Sharyati and Narisyanta.  How old is Sharyati?”

	“I am sixteen years old,” Sharyati replied obediently.

	“And Narisyanta?”

 	“Seven!”  Little Narisyanta squeaked. 

	Aum.  Ringing inside his mind, beating like his very pulse.  It energised him, filling him with a spirit that was infinite and all pervading.  “The Manu also had a daughter.  Who can tell me her name?”

	“Ila! Ila!”  Narisyanta piped, eager to one-up his elder brothers.  Beside him, the others snickered, teasing him as always.

	“Correct,” Vasishtha said approvingly.  “Pramshu, tell me of the Somavansha that comes from Ila’s son.

	Pramshu, at nineteen he was the Manu’s second son- and a Suryavansha prince by his own right.  “Ila’s son is Pururava Aila,” he said.  “His wife is the Apsara named Urvashi.  Pururava Aila is the first King of the Somavansha, and his one year old son, Ayu, is the heir.”  He said it dutifully, but Vasishtha sensed the boy was disinterested and bored.  He would rather be out in the barracks, training with the men instead of sitting inside libraries, memorising prayers and genealogies. 

Aum.  He wished he could broadcast it aloud, let it echo amongst the towns and cities, across rivers and mountains.  He felt the wind hum Aum, the running rivers gush Aum, and the booming clouds blare Aum.  Unbidden, a prayer came to him,

By Saryanavana’s side, let Indra the slayer of Vritra drink Soma;

He stores up vigour in his heart, prepared to conduct heroic deeds.  Flow, oh mighty Indu- flow for Indra’s sake.

He let it roll off his tongue, sensing how the vibration felt.  Then he said it again in his mind, trying to perceive the elements behind it.  This was the viraja meter, and its syllables flooded him with visions of war- primitive and pre-technological yet catastrophic in its destruction.  They had the ancient totems then, symbols of Deva and Asura as if they were the real entities descended on earth.  Vasishtha saw within the prayer the face of a man who called himself Indra- Leader of Devas.  Blood splashed across his vision as Indra slew Vrtra, the Asura King.  Aum, Vasishtha echoed again. 

	“Guru Vasishtha,” Nabhaga’s voice brought him back to the real world.  “When will Vikukshi join us again?”

	“And when will Ayu be old enough to join?”  Narisyanta added, eager not to be the youngest of the lot anymore. 

	“Vikukshi is still two years away from finishing his military training,” Vasishtha replied.  “And with the tutelage of men like Haryashva, Senapati Drishta and my father, I don’t think King Ikshvaku is in a hurry to change the situation.”  He turned to Narisyanta, who was soon becoming his favourite pupil, “And little Ayu is a Somavanshi, Narisyanta.  His education will be under the learned scholars of Maharshi Atri.”

	Narisyanta stooped, disappointed.  “Why are we not entitled to the Suryavanshi training, Guruji?”  Pramshu asked, making sure to keep his tone respectful.  “Even King Pururava of the Somavansha spent five years with them, and he is only King Ikshvaku’s nephew.  We are his jamaya- his brethren.”

	Vasishtha sighed.  He had no reply to the boy’s query.  Many in the city of Vitabhya wondered why King Ikshvaku had not sent for his brothers yet.  Vasishtha yearned to enquire himself, but when the Manu and Maharshi Vasishtha had not acted yet, he certainly could not.  “No one has said that you are not entitled,” Vasishtha replied, and that was true enough.  “We cannot question the decisions and priorities of King Ikshvaku.  Be assured, Pramshu, that he will ensure that your training commences when the time is right.”

 	Suddenly the boys stood up, and brought their palms together in a namaskara.  “Father,” Pramshu, Nabhaga, Sharyati and Narisyanta said; while Nimi greeted him with a “Grandfather.”  Vasishtha turned around to see the Manu standing and smiling at the entrance.  He brought his hands together too, and greeted the Seventh Progenitor of Man.  “Janapati Manu,” he said.

	The Supreme Clan Head Manu shook his head sideways and said, “No, Guruji.  You are the Purohita of my clan, you cannot fold your hands to me.  You may only be twenty six, but you are a Vasishtha.  I must bow to you.”  Manu folded his hands and bowed.

	Vasishtha accepted that with grace and nodded.  Aum, it consumed him.  Perhaps the Soma from last evening’s prayers had not completely worn off, and again a prayer came to him unbidden.

There was neither existence then nor non-existence, no realm of air and no sky beyond;

What gave shelter and where?  What took shelter and where?  Was there water?  Was there depth in the water?

	This one felt different the moment its first syllable came to him- potent and full of life.  It was a tristubha, the forty-four syllable meter.  He sensed more behind it and stretched his mind out, perceiving.  But there was nothing, only questions and mysteries.  What were these abstract concepts?  How did one define non-existence?  How could he imagine nothingness of this quality?  It required a complete extinction of the self, and he doubted if he was capable of that.  He had to take this tristubha to his father.  Only someone as powerful as Maharshi Vasishtha could unlock the secrets it hinted at.

	Manu observed the young Rshi, and allowed himself a chuckle.  Vasishtha’s eyes were closed in deep trance, something Manu had seen many a time upon Maharshi Vasishtha’s face.  The Maharshi was with Ikshvaku now, for Manu had decided that his son needed the venerable guidance far more than himself.  Maharshi Vasishtha mentored Ikshvaku the King for five years, before finally being blessed with a son of his own- Gauvitri.  “You have entrusted me with your son’s care,”the Maharshi had said to Manu before delivering Gauvitri to him.  “Now I place my son under yours.”  Gauvitri Vasishtha grew to be as wise and learned as his father, and now he was as overtaken by the frenzy of meditation as the Maharshi.  

	“Guru Vasishtha might take time to join us again,” Manu whispered to the boys, as Vasishtha continued to trance.  “Come, let us play some games out in the yard.  I’m sure he will not mind a shortening of your lessons for today!”

***

“You know well that I still do not grasp the technicalities, Maharshi,” said Ikshvaku.  “The talk of meters and codes only confuses me.  Deliver it to me raw, let me hear the vibrations and experience them for myself.”

	Father Vasishtha and son Vasishtha looked at each other.  Then the father said,

There was neither existence then nor non-existence, no realm of air and no sky beyond;

What gave shelter and where?  What took shelter and where?  Was there water?  Was there depth in the water?

There was neither death then nor immortality, no distinguishing sign of night and not of day;

The One breathed- windless, by its own impulse.  There was nothing beyond other than that.

Darkness was hidden by darkness in the beginning; with no distinguishing sign, all this was water;

The life force was covered with emptiness, the One arose through the power of heat.

Desire came upon the One in the beginning; that was the first seed of Mind;

This string that connects existence and non-existence is known to seers with wisdom in their hearts.

The string was extended across; But was there Below?  Was there Above? 

There were begetters and there were powers; There was impulse beneath; There was giving-forth above.

Who really knows?  Who here will proclaim it?  Whence was it produced?  Whence is this Creation?

The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.  Who then knows whence it has arisen?

Whence this creation has arisen, perhaps it formed itself and perhaps it did not.

The one who looks down on it from heaven, perhaps he knows and perhaps he does not.

Even translated into the colloquial Sanskrit, the hymns were beautiful to Ikshvaku’s ears.  And Vasishtha’s enunciation was perfect.  The father and son duo were meticulous about phonetics and pronunciation, as passionate about the meters of their codes as about the contents.  Ikshvaku ruminated on the words, trying to visualise their meaning.  Images of vast blackness and infinite light coagulated in his mind when Maharshi Vasishtha recited.  He experienced a fleeting sensation of what would have been omniscience, but it passed even before he could sense it.  He turned to the Vasishthas with eyes of deep respect- bowing to both father and son.  Gauvitri Vasishtha was the mirror image of his father, down to the way his nose curved slightly to the left. 

“What is this prayer called?”  Ikshvaku asked.

	“Nasadiya Sukta- the Eulogy of Non-Existence,” the younger Vasishtha replied, his voice sombre and deep. 

	“It is fitting,” Ikshvaku agreed.  “Maharshi Vasishtha, will you not enlighten me with some commentary on this tristubha?”

 	“What is Creation, King Ikshvaku?”  The Maharshi said.  “We have never enquired into this fundamental question.  And this prayers points us to the lament that we may never truly know.  Even the gods are younger to Creation, and so cannot fathom is entire nature.  Yet the prayer also offers us hitherto unexplored theories.  It will take months of meditation to unravel all its layers and prepare any form of summary.”

	“I suggest we transmit this prayer to the other schools,” Ikshvaku said.  “Maharshis Kashyapa and Atri must be informed immediately.  As soon as you can assign students to transmit the prayer, I will send them forth with riders.”

	“I will begin teaching them immediately,” the younger Vasishtha said. “But it will take time, King Ikshvaku.  It would not do to make our students memorise the prayer without understanding the layers of its meaning, without allowing them to perceive behind its veils themselves.”

	“Very well.  I have no desire to hasten you.  In the meantime, Haryashva has returned from his visit to Vitabhya.  Father has sent an elaborate message for me, it seems.  Maharshi Vasishtha, as always, I would like your presence and counsel.  I welcome your son’s as well, but I will not keep him from his priorities.  A return party can join Rshi Vasishtha if he wants to leave for Vitabhya at once.”

	“I would like to meet Haryashva the Ashvaka,” Gauvitri replied.  “I have heard much about him.”

	Haryashva claimed that his Ashvaka blood kept his looks young and his hair black, even as his age advanced.  But Ikshvaku had seen enough grey haired Ashvakas to know that it was another idle boast from his friend.  The only change in him in all these years was the hint of a belly that had begun to protrude.  He always loved his food, and now that most of his battle days were behind him he had allowed himself to, as Ikshvaku loved to say, “Let go a little bit.”

	The King and his Chief Minister, for that was Haryashva’s official title now, met like the old friends they were- in an affectionate, tight embrace.  Haryashva bowed to both Vasishthas in namaskara before taking his seat before the King.  “Elaborate plans from your father,” he said without preamble.

	“I expected as much.  Tell me all.”

“He reiterates his support for your policy of primogeniture, but warns that Vitabhya is not happy that its Suryavanshi princes are being ignored.  He reminds you that Avisari is too far away for the people’s loyalty to remain unwavering to a distant King, when the same bloodline exists in the princes in their city.”

“And what is his solution for this problem?”

“That you bring your brothers here to train, the way you trained Pururava so many years ago.  Whatever blood Pururava carries, it is his Suryavanshi warrior training that wins him true respect from his soldiers and enemies alike.  The Manu suggests that you provide the same brand of training for your brothers.”

“But does my father realise that Senapati Drishta is beyond seventy years now, and that you are nearing your middle age?” 

“Senapati Drishta is still the best tutor a young warrior can get, his experience and wisdom have only increased with age.  And I welcome the chance to train young fellows once again.  I had great fun with Pururava the last time around.  Don’t forget, your brothers can benefit from the wiles of Narantaka as well.”

“That they will not,” Ikshvaku replied immediately. “I will provide them the Suryavanshi training that Vitabhya wants me to, but I will not expose them to Narantaka.  The Rakshasa is too unpredictable.”

“Fine with me,” Haryashva replied nonchalantly.  “The Manu also wants you to provide your brothers with their own colonies within the Kingdom, once they are of age.”

“Maharshi Vasishtha has made the same proposal to me.  And Rshi Gauvitri hints that Pramshu and Nabhaga are getting restless playing the part of adolescent brothers.  But if I am to grant them colonies, then first I must win them colonies.  Send for Narantaka, I wish to speak with him.”

Haryashva eyed his King warily, “What are you planning, Ikshvaku?”

“Only something that I’ve delayed far too long.  It is time to begin the next theatre of battle, my Chief Minister.  We shall take our armies west of the Sindhu.”

“Is war wise at a time like this, King?”  The Maharshi warned.  “There are enough lands between the Sindhu and the Ganga, we do not need to look westward.”

“Lands that are already claimed,” Ikshvaku replied, “It is to the west that the new world lies, Maharshi.  I have long anticipated that the next phase of threats will come from tribes of men, not the exotic tribes.  As King, it is my duty to provide for the sustenance of my successors.  For that I have to give them new lands.  And in a few years, my brothers can take them for their colonies.”
