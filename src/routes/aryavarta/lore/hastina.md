“Heave!”  Varman grunted.  He pulled hard at his end of the net, and Kaushika complemented at the other end.  Together they hauled in their third cast of the day.  Once the mass of fish, prawns, crabs, weeds and junk was on their boat, they bent over and began sifting through it- putting the edible catches away into copper buckets.  

	Employed with one of Haradvara’s most prominent fishing guilds, Kaushika had come to enjoy the simple, unfettered life it gave him.  Men like Varman were pragmatic, amiable fellows with no feelings of misplaced superiority.  Varman, in particular, was hard-boiled to the point of being cynical.  He spoke with great disdain of both warriors and sages, and held a dismissive irreverence for royal dynasties that had offended Kaushika at first.  “Our catches are only getting better,” Kaushika said as they threw fish after fish into the buckets.  

	“They will continue to do so,” Varman said.  “Now that summer is setting in, the Himalayan glaciers will melt and fresh waves of these river creatures will wash down the rivers.  Are you sure you want to continue being employed without wage?”

	“The food and shelter the guild provides is more than enough for me, my friend.  It is best not to be without possessions.”

	Varman looked at Kaushika shrewdly.  “Only ascetics and nomads live with no possessions.”

	“You keep saying so, but I do not believe one needs to be either of those to attempt a life without attachment.”

	“To what purpose?”  Varman challenged.  “What will a detached existence give you?”

	Kaushika smiled.  “I do not really know that yet.  But I can intuitively sense that a life full of passion and desire is not the ideal state.  We would not have risen to the level of thinking, creating human beings were that the case.”

	Varman shook his head sadly.  “That’s the sort of mentality possessed by rshis and hermits.  Life is life, my dear friend- it appears in a flash and is gone in the next.  There are no higher purposes at work, no all-powerful entities working the levers.”

	“So life is just a coincidence?  You truly believe that it is without meaning?”

	“Not entirely,” Varman replied.  “There may not be any higher forces at play, but we are still free to attach relevance to our lives.  After all, we are victims to emotion and sentiment, to fondness and nostalgia.  But there can be no ideal state, Kaushika.  The very descriptive of ideal indicates a definitive superiority that you and I have no right to assign.”

	“I did not know you to be a philosopher,” Kaushika jested, admitting to himself that Varman’s argument merited consideration.   

	Varman flaunted his broken-toothed grin.  “And I know nothing about you, my mysterious friend.  You descended to us from the mountains, and proceeded to break every stereotype we may have held about men such as you.  You preached no prayers, claimed subscription to no Deva and cast no moral judgments on our various ways of living.  You even declined meeting with some of Haradvara’s biggest ashramas, and they soon realised that you were nowhere close to being one of them.”

	“I suspect a question somewhere in that narration of yours.”

	“Who are you, Kaushika of the mountains?  Where have you really come from?”

	Kaushika sighed.  He had been asked these questions several times before, but coming from Varman, they seemed to demand something more honest- or at least less laconic.  “I’m from Bharatvarsha,” he replied sincerely.  This made him a foreigner in Haradvara, which was ruled by the Purus.  Kaushika continued- “Specifically from the city of Kanyakubja.  I left home at a young age, and have been travelling ever since.”

	Varman was not satisfied by that.  “Only two types of men leave their homes for the wandering life,” he said.  “Those born to wealthy, comfortable families or those born to the most severely destitute.  I know you enough to say that you are not of the latter.  And your bearing has often suggested a royal, or at least noble upbringing.”

	“One day I will tell you all, my friend,” Kaushika promised truthfully.  “But let us leave some of my tale for later.  The sun is setting, and I think we can haul in one more cast before calling it a day.”

They sifted through another catch, and then rowed their boat back into the dock by the river.  Then they proceeded to the local fishermen’s bar, where Kaushika heard that a contingent of cavalry and soldiers had marched through Haradvara in the day.  Rumour was that there was a campaign building against the Bharata Kingdom of King Divodasa.  The Purus were a ferocious and war-ready tribe now, but that evening his thoughts went to Hastinapura’s founder- the pacifist King Hastina who revived the Puru dynasty after Mandhatra’s campaign destroyed it.  

***

**Year 657, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

He looked at the map, staring at it as he had countless times before.  The first phase went easier than expected.  Once King Samvarna was lost to the battle, the Bharata soldiers scattered in disarray, and Hastina had marched to Bharatpura unchallenged.  The town gave little resistance, citizens happy to accept any King, as long as they were left in peace.  It was Haradvara and Plaksha that Hastina sought.  But all along the route to Haradvara they were besieged by guerrilla bands of Bharata soldiers that had fled after Samvarna’s disappearance.  

	He arrived at Haradvara with less than three hundred men, and the knowledge that Bharata contingents were now pressing upon him, both from Plaksha in the north and from the southern cities of Kampilya and Kanyakubja.  This was not how Hastina had planned it.

	“You said that the people would welcome the return of a Puru King,” he said to Setu.  “You said the soldiers would run to swear loyalty to me.”

	“And they would still,” Setu insisted, “But they need to see you first.  Bharatpura was nothing, a frontier town maintained simply for its historical relevance.  It is Haradvara and Plaksha where the old families reside, where there are still rshis that remember the grey-eyed Kings.”

	Hastina spread his hands out wide, in the direction of the city.  “Haradvara stands before us, Setu,” he said, “Yet none step out to stand behind me.”

	Setu fell silent.

	“It is my grey eyes they need to see, is it not?”  Hastina asked.  “They grey eyes that are unmistakably Puru?”

	Setu nodded in confirmation.

	“Then let us step in.  Let us meet the Atri rshis and Yati munis.  Let us share with them our Veda, and let them verify that it is truly of Puru nature.  Will they deny me then?”  

	“They will not, my King,” replied Setu.

	“Do not call me that!”  Hastina snapped.  “I am King only when I step into the royal halls at Plaksha.  Come, let us enter the city.”

	Setu’s eyes widened.  “My King,” he protested, unable to help himself.  “That will be dangerous!”

	“Why?”  Hastina retaliated.  “There are no soldiers in Haradvara, it is a holy city.  We will enter unarmed.  What harm will come to us?”	

	Setu had no counter to that.  Haradvara was a town taken over with a spiritual frenzy that rivalled that of Kashi and Prayaga.  The Atri rshis ruled here, with their tradition of worship to the Prime Man- the conscious entity that preceded all other conscious entities.  It was this Prime Man who propagated Existence itself, or at least that was the belief.  Haradvara was a city given to rituals of Hiranyagarbha, Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana and of late, Purusha- the Primeval Being as mortal man himself, a dream recently nurtured.   

	Hastina led the way, entering Haradvara from its western gate.  Unlike the settlements of Sindhu-Sarasvati, the towns of Ganga-Yamuna were unplanned and unambitious.  There was no coherent architecture and no large, defining structures.  The only organized constructions were along the river bank- various domed and intricately carved structures of brick and wood.  The wood was polished, and the brick coloured bright orange.  It was out of one of such structures that a rshi stepped out and approached Hastina and Setu, who had otherwise walked through Haradvara ignored by the denizens.  That there was a contingent of soldiers parked right outside their town did not seem to matter to Haradvara’s people.

	The rshi was scantily clad in a thin, orange fabric.  Unlike the usual image of a rshi, this one was clean shaven, and his hair was of a medium cut.  There was a knowing look in his eyes and he said amiably, “Welcome, Hastina Puru,” spreading his arms wide.

	Hastina bent his neck in respect and asked, “You know my identity, rshi?”

	“It is known that the grey eyes have only appeared in those directly descended from Pururava, and then Puru,” the rshi replied somberly.  “And accurate records of Puru lineage exist only in Haradvara and Plaksha.”   

	“Then you will accept my claim as King?”  Hastina asked.

	The rshi raised his head, assessing Hastina with a shrewd look in his eyes.  “Authority and Power are realms of warriors, Hastina Puru,” he said.  “I am a rshi, it is not my place to declare Kings and rulers.”

	“Where can I find a warrior clan to accept my claim then?” 

	“If your claim is valid,” said the rshi, “Then why do you need another to accept it?”

	“What is a King without his subjects?”  Hastina challenged.

	“Ah,” said the rshi wisely.  “So the subjects hold the true power?  We are a janapada then, not a rajya.  A republic, not a monarchy, and Kings are not needed here.  Go away, Hastina Puru.”

	Setu frowned, one did not talk to his King in this manner.  “Watch your words, rshi,” he warned.  “This is a Puru King you talk to.”

	“No,” said Hastina, “The rshi is correct.  This is why there is no military at Haradvara, why the city is given to rshis and ascetics even though it is within the borders of the Bharata Kingdom.”

	The rshi nodded softly.

	“But a janapada,” Hastina continued, “still has a ruler or a governing body.  And so there must be one at Haradvara.  You will take me to them, rshi.”

	The rshi smiled.  “There is no need for that,” he said, “For the ruler has come to you.  Here I am, Hastina Puru.  My name is Angirasa, as is that of my students and peers.  There are some Kanvas among us, some Medhatithis and some Praskanvas.  Together, we form the ascetic janapada of Haradvara, and it is in Plaksha where you will find the old clans and families.”

	 “I will still need rshis to verify my Veda and solemnize my claim.”

	“Go to Plaksha,” Angirasa insisted again.  “No Atri rshi will turn his back on you after seeing those grey eyes.”

***

Plaksha- a town more than seven hundred years old.  This was where the Maharshi Atri was born, and where he set up his first schools.  His descendant Pururava founded the Somavansha dynasty at Plaksha and later, when he shifted to Pratisthana, it was here that the original Somavanshi bloodlines survived.  Hastina gazed at the town from afar, his passage blocked by the Bharata contingent in front of him.  The leader looked back at him defiantly, and at the pitiful amount of soldiers behind him.  

	The leader looked beyond him and spoke to his soldiers, pointing to him, “This man’s life is forfeit- no pretender can be spared.  But your lives are not yet lost.  Drop your arms, and you will receive minimum punishments.”

	No man reacted, and Hastina grinned.  He walked towards the leader and then further, towards the enemy line.  “Who are you?”  He asked of the enemy soldiers.  “Are you men of Plaksha?  Are you of families that have lived in these lands since the time of Maharshi Atri?”  He knew that they were.  Hastina pointed back south, “Men come from there, with weapons, horses and elephants to enforce their law and will here- at Plaksha.”  Hastina forced his gaze at one soldier, “But what are Kampilya and Kanyakubja to you?  Why do they rule over you?  Why do you fight for them?”

	“Enough!”  The Bharata leader barked, walking back towards Hastina menacingly.  “Return to your line, pretender, or I will have your head!”

	Hastina ambled towards his men, shouting out back to the enemy, “Haradvara calls itself a janapada- a republic.”  He turned around again, and spoke to the leader this time.  “There was once another janapada here.  An older and far more binding tie united these lands.  It was the jana of Puru, descended directly from Pururava and Maharshi Atri.  That is what Plaksha is, a Puru janapada.  What has the Bharata dynasty done for you?  It was Pururava who cleansed this land of Yakshas and Gandharvas, and it were Nahusha and Yati who founded Haradvara.  Yet you allow this foreign tribe to call this land its own.”

	He had walked close to the leader now, their faces inches from each other.  Hastina glared at him, letting the man see the soma-soaked eyes that he would only have heard of, from his forefathers.  “I am here,” he whispered to him reassuringly.  “The Purus are back.  We can take back what is ours, what our ancestors fought for when they chased Bharata out.  Join your strength with mine.”

 	The man’s gaze faltered, and Hastina knew he had won.  “What would your forefathers have done?”  He asked, pressing his victory.  “Would they rather you fight on the side of Puru blood, or of Bharata?”

***

“I don’t care about Kampilya!”  Hastina snapped.  “They can keep it.  It is Ahikshetra I want.”

	“And for that you will have to take Kampilya, my King,” insisted Rohan, leader of Plaksha’s warrior community.  “It is Samvarna’s capital, and all the strength of the northern Bharatas is concentrated there.  Even if we take Ahikshetra, we will not be able to keep it.  Kampilya will constantly immediately send a recapturing party.”

	“The same will happen with Kampilya,” countered Setu.  “Once we take that city, Kanyakubja will set its might against us.”

	“Not necessarily,” said Rohan.  “Kanyakubja is on the other side of the Ganga.  If we can block the passage, we can effectively resist the Bharatas.  Even Prayaga and Kashi will be unable to help.”

	Once Rohan and the warrior contingent of Plaksha allied with him, Hastina was able to repel the attack contingent from Kampilya.  But it was only a matter of time before the city sent more forces.  His army was now more than two thousand strong, for soldiers had come from far and wide once news of a Puru King in Plaksha had spread.  This army was camped further south of Haradvara, at a spot ceremoniously named Hastinapura by the school of Atri rshis that allied with him as soon as he walked into Plaksha. 

	“What of the Suryavanshi?” Hastina asked.  “Reports have it that Sravasti is a mighty military town, and there is news of a Suryavanshi settlement in the Naimisharanya.”

	“I do not think the Suryavanshi are a problem,” admitted Setu.  “Sravasti is busy battling Gandharvas from the north and Rakshasas from the south.”

	“And we can enlist the help of the Yadavas,” added Rohan.  “The sons of Yadu and the sons of Puru are bound by blood; and Ekachakra is as hostile to the Bharata Kingdom as we are.”

	“So Kampilya must be taken,” concluded Hastina, “And passage across the Ganga blocked.  In the meantime, send scouts to Bharatpura and Khandakvana.  I want to know what happened of King Samvarna.  Someone has either found his body, or helped him survive.”

***

“Set a patrol along the forest as well,” Hastina said.  “We cannot rule out that path.”

	“It is unlikely,” said Rohan, “But as you say, my King.”  He left to transmit Hastina’s message.  The rain was incessant, pouring down in huge, fat drops.  Everything was wet, and the mud was slippery and sloshy.  Progress was slow and halted as chariots and horses would get stuck in puddles and nascent swamps.  And they were vulnerable out here- in the middle of Ahikshetra, Kampilya and Hastinapura.  Any moment, Hastina expected the advance scouts to return with news that the Kampilyan contingent had been spotted.  

	“Will this rain never stop?”  Setu cursed.

	Through the rain a scout returned on his horse, breathless and agitated.  “My King,” he mumbled, “Elephants, hundreds of elephants!”  Then a second returned after him, relaying the same news.  And then a third returned and confirmed it.  The Bharata contingent of Kampilya was marching at him with an army of elephants.

	 “We cannot remain here,” Setu said.  “If what these men say is true, then we will be crushed here in this mud and rain.  We must retreat, my King.”

	“Where does an army of two thousand retreat to?”  Hastina challenged.  “My father named me Hastina, and it is elephants that march against me today!  This is how fates conspire against the righteous, my old friend.  No, we will march forward.  We will meet this army of elephants.  Hastina against the hastinas- that will be the sight.”

***

He was wet with rain, blood and mud.  It was impossible to discern between the enemy soldier and one of his own.  Once the battle commenced and the smell of blood exploded, the elephants became the true enemy.  They ran amok, trampling men indiscriminately in their wild attempts to flee the carnage.  They broke lines, both enemy and their own, and crushed entire groups of men in their frenzy.  Even now, he could hear the sickening sounds of bone and flesh being crushed as the last of the elephants tried to flee the scene, indifferent to the lives being lost under their feet.  Hastina felt a grim and guilty satisfaction knowing that at least the Kampilyans had not won.  But then he heard another crunching and popping sound, and realized that it could easily have been him there, crushed and trampled.  His eyes scanned the scene, trying to find Setu and Rohan amid the mess of blood and mud.  Soldiers limped around him, both enemy and his own.  The fighting had stopped a long time ago, neither side having the heart or strength to continue.  

	“Fellow warrior” groaned a man on the ground, “Please, help me.”

	Hastina bent over and brought the man’s head to his lap.  The insignia on the armour was Bharata, but it did not matter at the moment.  Hastina wiped the grime and mud off the man’s face.  His legs were entirely crushed, and blood was oozing out in large gushes.  Even through the pain, the man’s eyes went to Hastina’s and widened.  “Grey!”  He whispered while grimacing.  “Truly grey,” he continued.  “You really are Puru!”

	Hastina nodded grimly, lamenting that he could do nothing for the man.  He cursed himself.  The returning Puru King had brought death and blood with himself.  How could he claim the right to rule after this?  He looked around him again- only a pitifully small amount of men still stood or limped, and that was counting both sides of the battle.  Thousands of men had lost their lives today, and the few elephant carcasses were a reminder of the how that had happened.  Even the metallic glint of broken, twisted chariots could not hide the black and red of numerous corpses.    

	“End it,” the man said, his voice hoarse with pain.  “A soldier does not fear death, he welcomes it.  I shall join the world of Indra, Soma and Agni with pride.  End my life, Puru King.”

	Hastina sighed, knowing what he must do.  “May the Devas be with you, fellow warrior,” he said, and thrust his dagger into the man’s heart, twisting it to cut veins and tissue.  Blood gurgled out of his throat and wound, but there was a faint smile on his face as he breathed his last.  The deed done, Hastina stood up and surveyed the carnage around him.  Was this the sight at Pratisthana, when the Suryavanshi Sindhudvipa had laid siege to it?  Was this the condition at Avisari, Rajavasa or Vitabhya, when those ancient cities were attacked?  This is how war is, a voice spoke in his head, grim and devastating.  Suddenly, Hastina felt devoid of any ambition, of any desire to avenge the death of his forefathers and the conquest of their Kingdoms.  Haradvara and Plaksha had accepted him peacefully, and from there Hastinapura he could give those towns the righteous rule they deserved.  These Bharatas could keep the rest.  The cycle of war and violence had to end somewhere, and it would end with him.
