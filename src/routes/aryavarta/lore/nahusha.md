“Ikshvaku left behind a large and powerful Kingdom for his son,” said Rshi Vasishtha.  “At the time of his death, the territory ranged from Kapisa and Avisari in the north to Vitabhya in the south, encompassing the autonomous towns of Trigarta and Madra and extending all the way to Vinasana by the Sarasvati.”

	“That would make the Kingdom almost as large as Bharatvarsha,” said Sudasa.  

	“Indeed,” agreed Vasishtha, “But it did not survive for as long as the Grand Bharata Kingdom has.  We will pick up the story of Suryavansha later on, but now we must move to the Somavansha- to the descendants of Pururava.  But before that, it is time for a test, young one.”

	Sudasa raised his eyebrows in response.

	“Yes, a test,” Vasishtha repeated.  “I need to know if you are retaining what you are being taught, if you are understanding the finer points of our itihasa.”

	Sudasa bowed his head respectfully.  “I am ready, guruji.” 

	“Then explain to me, young Sudasa, where did Ikshvaku’s power come from?  Why did the prime Solar dynasty find such authority and loyalty in Aryavarta?”

	“After the last Deva-Asura war, while most of the Devas migrated east into the Himalaya, several turned west and journeyed beyond the Sindhu,” Sudasa explained.  “Prominent among them were Surya, Mitra and Varuna.  Surya’s descendants became the nomadic Solar tribes that were led into Aryavarta by Marici- who was his direct descendant.  This in turn lent credibility to Ikshvaku, when he claimed the title of King.  The people accepted his Devic-ancestry, and considered him a son of Surya himself.”

	Vasishtha smiled approvingly.  “Very good, young one,” he said.  “And how would you explain Pururava’s legitimacy?”

	“In a similar fashion,” Sudasa replied.  “Plaksha was Soma-Deva’s last home before he went into the Himalaya, and the Maharshi Atri was Soma’s descendant.”

	“Excellent,” said Vasishtha.  “It is important that you understand this, Sudasa.  The days of Ikshvaku and Pururava were simpler and closer to the Age of Devas.  They could consolidate power just by the merit of their inheritance.  But that is no longer true.  Kings now have no higher claims to cement their might, no divine assent of their Kingship.  Your great ancestor, Bharata, did not have any Deva to rely on for power- he had to use brute force to carve a Kingdom for himself.”

	“When can I learn about First King Bharata, guruji?”  Sudasa asked.

	“Soon,” Vasishtha replied.  “But now it is time to move to the young Nahusha- grandson to Pururava.”

“Gentle," the father warned, "Look into his eyes with nothing but calmness."

Nahusha nodded and obeyed, giving the elephant his best innocent look- the one that melted even grandfather.  Remembering the other instructions received from his father, he allowed the elephant to prod him with its enormous trunk, forcing himself not to retch at the stink emanating from its nozzle.  The elephant pushed him gently, but the force was enough to make Nahusha struggle back a few steps.  Some paces behind him, Ayu tensed, waiting to see how his son would react.

Nahusha grunted deliberately, keeping his gaze locked with the elephant's.  "No," he said, before placing his right hand firmly on the elephant's trunk.  The trunk tightened, but Nahusha did not remove his hand.  Instead, he began rubbing the trunk thoroughly and affectionately, moving closer to the beast.  The elephant accepted his advances, and wrapped his trunk fondly around Nahusha before picking him up and placing him upon its back.  Ayu laughed at the look of surprise on his son's face as he was hoisted up, before it broke into a wide and supremely triumphant grin.  The elephant's attention turned to Ayu and it recognised him instantly, walking up to its old friend with his son sitting proudly on its back.  

"When can I try with a wild elephant, father?"  Nahusha asked from atop the elephant, adolescent confidence dripping from his cheeks.

"Soon," Ayu said, “You must practice with some more tamed ones first."  He patted the elephant affectionately and said, "Sambhu here is among the gentler of their kind, open to making new friends."  He extended his hands forward and helped his son dismount Sambhu, who gave a friendly call with his trunk.

"Is it true that you and grandfather tamed the first wild elephants?"  Nahusha asked of his father as they walked back towards the resting pavilion.  The day was nice and cool, with dark clouds lending hope for some much needed rain.  It had snowed incessantly on the mountains nearby, but south of Plaksha was humid and dry for weeks now.  Not that this was unfamiliar weather so close to the Khandakvana, it had just never been so prolonged before.  Here in the training grounds, both man and elephant sweated freely, giving an odd, sour smell to the whole area.  Still, it was nothing that the nose did not get used to after a while, and Nahusha was glad to get any chance to be close to the elephants.

"Certainly not," replied Ayu.  "The first wild elephants were tamed by the great Devas, in the times before ours.  Indra Deva rode a great, white elephant with four tusks."

"Airavata," Nahusha said instantly, "I know that story."

"Good," said Ayu, "You have been paying attention to Rshi Atri."

"Grandfather always says that it is as important to listen to Rshi Atri, as it is to Senapati Devapi," Nahusha replied.

"And grandfather is right," said Ayu, thinking of his aging father with mild concern.  The old and ex-King Pururava had not been keeping well of late, having taken the death of his beloved wife Urvashi very badly.  They reached the outer steps to the royal complex, which rose out on a circular pedestal in front of them, wide and imposing.  The pedestal was made of solid stone bricks brought from Trigarta, the independent mining town on the western bank of the Sarasvati.  Each brick was a perfect cuboid, its sides smooth and gleaming grey.  The entire structure was so heavy that it had sunk many steps into the ground after a single season of rain, but the architect had planned for it, and so the actual steps began at perfect ground level.  They were narrow and tightly-spaced, soon Nahusha's feet would outgrow them and he would climb awkwardly- just like everyone else.  This too was a deliberate design, for the steps were the only way to make it inside the royal complex, and their uncomfortable size made it all the more difficult for an invading army to make the ascent.  It was certainly not a permanent structure, for sooner or later the stone bricks would begin wearing out, after grinding against each other and baking under the sun for years.  But for now it served the purposes of the Somavansha.

Father and son began the ascent, the son a few eager steps ahead.  “There is something else,” Ayu called out from behind, “I think its best you hear it from me than from Rshi Atri or Senapati Devapi.”

Nahusha slowed down to climb alongside his father.  “What is it, father?”  There was mild concern in his furrowed brows.

Ayu chose his words carefully, anxious not to hurt his son.  “We will have to separate for a while, my son,” he said.  “When I return to Pratisthana, you will not be coming with me.”

Nahusha stopped now, knowing that the moment he long dreaded had finally arrived.  But wanting to appear brave and adult in front of his father, he said, “I think I expected this, father.”

Ayu raised his eyebrows.  “You did?”  He asked.  “Do you know what I am talking about, son?”

Nahusha nodded.  “It is time for me to join the Suryavanshi, just like you did in your time, and grandfather before you.”

They resumed a slow, careful climb up the stairs.  “Yes,” Ayu said, feeling pride at how calmly his fifteen-year old son was accepting the matter.  “There is no substitute for the training one receives among the Suryavanshi warriors and horses.  And Rshi Atri agrees that it will do you good to spend some time under the tutelage of Vasishtha and Kashyapa rshis.”

Nahusha nodded again, feeling oddly hollow inside.  He had known that this day would come, having heard numerous stories from his grandfather and father about the years they spent with the Suryavansha.  And grandfather had done so among legends such as Ikshvaku, Maharshi Vasishtha, Senapati Drishta and that Ashvaka- whose name Nahusha could never remember.  It was a dynastic tradition, and Nahusha had to accept it like a responsible Somavanshi princeling.  

***

**Year 116, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

“There,” pointed Shashada, three years younger to Nahusha, “Do you see it?”

	“No,” Nahusha replied, quite certain that Shashada was only putting him on.  

	“It’s the tallest one in the distance,” Shashada said, emphasizing towards the direction he pointed in, “And you can even see its lower part, the one not covered in snow.”

	Nahusha did catch the peak now, soaring indeed higher than any around it, though even from here it was clear that it was not nearly as high as the mountains around Avisari.  

	“The glorious peak of Sringara,” Shashada said reverently.  “From the Sringara mountain, you can catch a clear sight to Rajavasa or Prasthala.  Rajavasa gives view to Sakala, and in Sakala you can get a glimpse all the way down to Vitabhya on the clearest days.  Even Vinasana would be visible, before the forest took back the region south-east of Sakala.”

	Now Nahusha was sure that Shashada was putting him on.  This was a common myth he heard in Suryavanshi lands- that their cities were so placed that each was visible from the one before it.  It was said to be a design of the Great King Ikshvaku, intended so that all cities could keep a watch on their neighbours and ensure they were safe.  Nahusha had not been to Sringara or Rajavasa, but he had been to Sakala.  Nothing was visible around that ancient town save dense forest.  He stayed silent though, not wanting to break Shashada’s childhood illusions yet.

	Shashada made for an enjoyable companion otherwise, his Solar genes lending him a natural fearlessness and candour that was refreshing.  Even at fifteen, he had strong limbs and a lithe, lean body.  The Suryavanshi started their training at an earlier age and though he was younger, Shashada could equal and often best Nahusha at any sport or martial game.  Nahusha did not mind that, it gave him motivation to train harder and push himself.  Not that it was particularly needed in a land as martial and regimented as the Suryavansha’s.  Discipline and rigour came easily to him here, surrounded as he was by tall, hardened and austere men.  King Vikukshi was the son of Late King Ikshvaku, and a man as great as his father.  The Senapati was an intimidating, no nonsense Ashvaka named Shravashva, whose formidable bearing was matched only by that of Rshi Gauvitri Vasishtha, head of the Vasishtha school of Rshis and son to the late Maharshi Vasishtha.  

	The general Suryavanshi populace was no less sombre than its leaders, as Nahusha had come to find.  From Avisari to Vitabhya the people lived in harsh, rigid conditions with the shadow of war forever looming over them.  King Vikukshi had given his life to war, battling Dasa hordes invading from the west season after season.  Soon it would be Shashada’s turn to join his father in battle, and the Suryavanshi prince appeared every bit eager and ready for it.

	It was the peak of winter, but the generous Sun shone down brilliantly.  The boys were able to ride back to the ancient Palace without needing their shrouds.  Here in Suryavanshi lands, the Sun occupied greater majesty.  Life was conducted only in the day, when the bright-orange disk beat down heat and light always unhindered by clouds.  But east of the Sarasvati, in the lands of Ganga and Yamuna where the Lunar Dynasty ruled, the Moon’s brilliance in the night sky outmatched the Sun’s in the day.  Life bustled well into the night, trading centers and animal sheds brimming with people.  There the clouds dared to cloak the Sun, but never paled the Moon’s silver glow. 

	The Palace of Avisari had a strange, hushed aura when the boys entered.  Whether intentionally or not, Shashada always stepped into the Palace a few paces ahead of Nahusha, as if he was establishing his ownership.  The Suryavanshi were a fiercely proud people, prone to keeping even friends and allies at arm’s length, and Nahusha had learnt that by now.  Attendants stepped softly into the shadows as Nahusha and Shashada walked through the corridors towards the main private hall, where the royal family and its close advisors gathered in the time they had to rest and relax.  Nahusha was always awed inside the Palace, unable to digest that he walked on grounds where Ikshvaku and Maharshi Vasishtha themselves once did, as did his own father and grandfather.  It gave the Palace a very strange aura of being supremely ancient and completely recent at the same time.  No voices carried to them as they neared the private hall, and both Nahusha and Shashada walked in with soft, curious frowns.

	King Vikukshi was seated on his throne, his expression grim.  Queen Mandhavi’s face was similarly clouded, and she looked to Nahusha with an expression nearing sympathy.  A few Vasishtha rshis sat some steps away, one of them softly muttering mantras invoking Surya- the giver of life.  

	“Why is everyone so quiet?”  Shashada asked, oblivious to the air of sorrow inside the hall.

	“There is some news from Pratisthana,” said King Vikukshi, eyeing Nahusha with a look that eerily resembled the one his father had, when he told Nahusha that he would have to go off to Avisari.

	Nahusha looked at the King and then the Queen, and back at the King again, realizing that something terrible had happened.  Father had suffered a serious wound during training recently, and the last news was that he was still in fragile recovery.  “What is it, Uncle,” he asked, using the familiar term for a father’s close friend.  

	“Come here child, come and sit next to me,” said Queen Mandhavi, in a voice laden with consolation.  

	Nahusha obeyed, wishing that they would just tell him.  When he was seated, Queen Mandhavi wrapped her arms around him and wiped the hair off his forehead, looking at him with a mix of affection and gloom.  “It is nothing to worry, my dear,” she said, “Just something that you should be there for.”

	“You father’s health has taken a turn for the worse, Nahusha,” King Vikukshi said, “You have been called back to Pratisthana.”

	At that, Queen Mandhavi burst into tears, hugging Nahusha tightly and clasping his forehead.  It was then that Nahusha knew.  King Vikukshi was only doing him a small mercy, by sparing him the news till he reached Pratisthana.  King Ayu- his father, was no more.

**Year 125, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

 “Aryavarta!”  King Nahusha shouted at the top of his voice.  

	“Aryavarta!”  His men took up the cry.  Far in the distance, the cry was taken up by more than three thousand soldiers, and it rang across the sky as if the very clouds had burst above them.

	“Aryavarta!”  Nahusha shouted again, feeling his heart pump harder than it had ever before.

	“Aryavarta!”  The shout went across the air again.

	Giving his men a wide, triumphant smile, Nahusha turned his horse around and faced the vast, barren land ahead of them.  This was land of the Vanaras and Gandharvas, and Nahusha was here to end this war once and for all.  He brought out his conch and blew into it hard.  The roar of the conch and three thousand men went up together, and at just that moment Nahusha charged ahead.  Behind him his army followed, galloping full speed into enemy territory.  

***

“We cannot fight this, my lord,” said Sarvavarman, looking at the oncoming cloud of dust and soot that was Nahusha’s army.  

	“I know,” said Chitraveera, Lord and Ruler of the Gandharvas of lower Sarasvati.  “But what choice do we have?”

	A lone hillock was where he had parked his force of five hundred Gandharvas.  A further thousand were scattered south, along the river.  But this oncoming army was a swarm that would swallow them all, with their stone axes and wooden spears.  Chitraveera had to give credit to Nahusha, the enemy King.  He had shown remarkable patience and restrain, despite the repeated raids into their lands.  On some abstract level, he understood that it was not right to steal what belonged to another, but there was no other way to acquire cows or metals, or dozens of other things.  Now, it was time to pay for their violations.

	“What are your orders?”  Sarvavarman asked.

	“We will make our stand from here,” said Chitraveera.  “This hillock provides us the only advantage we can hope for.  Let them make the climb uphill, with our arrows, spears and boulders raining down upon them.”

***

Nahusha frowned, instinct telling him that something was not right.  The small hill in the distance was the only physical feature visible for all around them.  If there were any Gandharvas here, they would have to be hidden among the jagged rocks atop the hill.  At their pace they would be upon the hill within minutes, and by then it would be too late to react to a surprise attack.  He quickly signalled away two units from behind him.  One unit of three hundred riders curved away to the left, and another to the right.  Then he blew his conch again in a practiced tone, and the remainder of the force fanned out behind him, forming the eagle formation.  

	The eagle approached the hill slowly, almost gliding across the landscape and spreading its wings out further and further, till they caught up with the two units that had fanned out earlier.  The main, central force came to a halt, but the wings tapered and extended till they joined each other at the other side of the hill.  Men continued to ride sideways along the arc, out from the main force and towards the tapered wings.  

	Nahusha surveyed the circular formation of soldiers around the hill, and felt pride for his men.  Archers had taken cover behind the cavalry ranks, while swordsmen stood in units amid the cavalry, always leaving space for the horses to gallop ahead instantly if needed.  As always, the circle of elephants was outermost.  Nahusha beckoned to the nearest cavalry head, who galloped towards him right away.

	“The Gandharvas have taken cover on this hill,” Nahusha said to him.  “I do not think they would have more than five or six hundred men up there, but their position gives them an advantage.  The horses will go no closer to the hill.”

	The man nodded smartly.  “We must find a way to distract their archers while our main line climbs up,” he said.  Nahusha was a King who welcomed the opinion of his common soldiers, and there were no commanders or chiefs of army to intercept that direct line of communication.

	“No,” Nahusha said.  “This is not the only group of Gandharvas we will come up against, and I do not want to sustain more losses than we have to.  Not until we know which side the Vanaras stand on.”

***

Chitraveera admired the absolute perfection in this army.  It changed its form, from a singular horde moving forward, to a graceful arc that grew in length till it circled the entire hill with amazing swiftness.  Somewhere down in those lines of men was Nahusha.  Chitraveera had never seen him, but he had heard enough of the Somavanshi King of the Ganga and Yamuna.  Nahusha was of the dynasty that had driven out Gandharvas from Plaksha to Pratisthana, and now his sights were set on Chitraveera’s territories.  

	“Archers ready,” he whispered to Sarvavarman, who relayed the command down the lines.

	Then he saw a lone rider break out from the enemy formation and ride towards the base of the hill with a fluttering, white flag.  Chitraveera frowned, what new tactic was this?  But instinct told him that a single man ride with a white flag was not to be considered malevolent.  He held out his arm, telling his archers to hold their fire.  “Tell someone to approach that rider,” he said to Sarvavarman.  “But keep distance.”

	A little while later, Sarvavarman came back with a message from the enemy rider.  “King Nahusha of the Somavansha wants to talk to you,” he said.

	Chitraveera frowned- this was new.  The Somavanshi did not wait to talk and negotiate when they rode out.  The Gandharvas of Khandakvana and Naimisharanya had taught him that lesson.  What was this Nahusha up to?  

	“It’s a trap,” Sarvavarman warned.  

	“A trap for what?”  Chitraveera asked.  “We are surrounded on all sides, and shamefully outnumbered.”

	“The dynastic system of these Somavanshi is different,” Sarvavarman offered.  “They are nothing without their King and ruler.  He contains all the authority and power.  Perhaps they assume similar for us?”

	Chitraveera smiled wryly.  “Would you not obey me with as much loyalty as that horseman does Nahusha?”  

	“I would,” Sarvavarman replied instantly, before bowing his head low respectfully and adding- “But the Gandharvas would survive without you, while the Somavanshi are nothing without their King.”

	Sarvavarman had a point, but Chitraveera wanted to meet King Nahusha.  This was a man of the famed Somavanshi dynasty- second in glory only to those Suryavanshi on the Sindhu.  And Chitraveera had encountered a few Suryavanshi in his time.  He had tested the Solar fire, now he wanted to assay the Lunar ice.  

	“I will meet Nahusha,” Chitraveera said decidedly.  “It is our honour that is more circumspect here.  I think King Nahusha would instead kill me through honest battle than deceit.”

***

They were men of equal height and build- Nahusha and Chitraveera.  Both sported rough beards and locked hair, eyes glinting at each other in suspicion and assessment.  To them was descended a tribal rivalry that had found no solution besides war.  Chitraveera stood there with a defiant arrogance to match his counterpart’s.  Fierce brown eyes to match the cold grey.  

	“I do not desire war and death,” Nahusha said.  Chitraveera was surprised at the voice.  He expected it to be different from the Gandharvas’- alien and unfamiliar.  Instead, it sounded like any he heard among his own people.  Nahusha continued, “And I am certain neither do you.  No sane man would.”  His dialect was not too far off either, easily recognizable to Chitraveera and quite distant from Suryavanshi dialects.  

	“You surround me on all sides with men and beasts ready for battle,” Chitraveera replied.  “We are way past what we desire now, King Nahusha.”

	“We are not,” Nahusha countered.  “The first arrow has not been shot, and neither has a sword been unsheathed.  What happens to all these men depends on the two of us, and I believe we can find peace between us yet.”

	Chitraveera frowned sceptically.  “You can forget the raids into your lands?  You can dismiss the rivalries your father and grandfather gave their lives too?”

	Nahusha shook his head in the negative.  “I cannot forget, but I can look to the future.  It is not the decimation of Gandharvas that my ancestors sought, it was peace and safety for their people.  But as your numerous raids have proven, that peace has not been achieved.  It is time we try a different strategy, Chitraveera.  Then perhaps, by the time my grandson becomes King, he can forget the raids his ancestors once suffered.”

	“I cannot promise you that Gandharvas will no longer intrude into your territories, King Nahusha.  I do not hold that kind of power over our kind.”

	“I am aware of the confederate nature of your governance,” Nahusha said.  “But that does not mean you hold no power.  I have heard stories of you, Chitraveera.  You and your people have interacted much with rshis from Vinasana to Vitabhya.  You have forged ties with Vanaras, Yakshas and Rakshasas- negotiating peace where others failed.  There are even ballads of your friendship with the Suryavanshi King Shashada.  I submit that if you and I could reach a consensus, then the Gandharva confederation might just back you.”

	Chitraveera smiled wryly.  Nahusha had done his research well, taking time to know the leader of the Gandharvas he rode against.  And it was true that there was an understanding between Chitraveera and King Shashada of the Suryavansha- though Gandharvas had never intruded into Suryavanshi lands, as they had into the Somavanshi.  But every negotiation, every truce came with a price.  “What offer do you bring then, King Nahusha?  You would like our raids to cease, for your cattle and metals to be safe.  But you control the rivers, you control the crossings and now, you control the woods of the forest as well.  You have cut my people off from the land, and driven us into the wilderness between the Sarasvati and Yamuna.  What are we to do for survival?”

	“People are one of two types, Chitraveera- arya or anarya.  They are either noble and true to this land, or they are not.  The Gandharvas call it Aryavarta just like us, and your myths and legends are of the same Devas as ours.  You remember the names of Bhrigu, Kashyapa, Varaha, Vritra, Daksha and Pulastya- just like we do.  That makes us the same people- children of the same land.  The only thing that separates us now is our actions.  There are both aryas and anaryas among the Somavanshi, as there are among the Gandharvas.  I believe that you are an arya- surely you see why your actions have been wrong.  We can find a way to share this land together- to distribute its rivers and forests among us, in a way that neither side suffers.”

	“You would share the Sarasvati and Yamuna with us?”  Chitraveera asked, incredulous.

	“I would,” Nahusha replied without hesitation.  “The ancient towns of Vrukasthali and Yamaprastha once belonged to your ancestors.  I will gladly return them to you.  The Sarasvati is empty and unsettled beyond Viratpuri- take it and make new homes there, should your numbers increase.  Trigarta and Madra are independent towns, run by tribes that have allegiance to no party in Aryavarta.  The Gandharvas can exist similarly, but you will have to respect our borders as much as we will respect yours.”

	Chitraveera drew a deep breath.  There was still dust in the air from the swift, large-scale movements of Nahusha’s horde.  This was the last thing he expected when news reached him that the Somavanshi King marched for Gandharva blood.  Chitraveera knew that Nahusha and his men could easily route his petty force, and surely Nahusha knew that as well.  Yet he was opting for a peaceful resolution- one that Chitraveera himself desired, but did not think possible.  Now Nahusha was offering him an opportunity, but would the Gandharva confederation agree to it?  Enmity between the two tribes ran deep, and Gandharvas would not forget the armies of Ayu and Pururava so soon.  But what Nahusha said of Aryavarta was true, and Chitraveera did indeed consider himself to be a true arya.  He had no choice but to accept the King’s offer.

**Year 150, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

“This is our country, our land.  Our rivers and our cattle,” said Yayati, his younger son, tapping his chest proudly.

	“And who are your people, exactly,” challenged Nahusha, prodding his son to question his dogmas and beliefs.  “When you proclaim all of this to be yours, who are you talking about?”  Yayati had inherited the guarded xenophobia of his grandfather, and had to be shorn of that.

	At that Yayati hesitated, trying to work out the question.  That was always father’s style, to make him define the very concepts they argued about.  “You must begin at the very concept of society itself,” Nahusha said, trying to aid his son’s thinking.  “Why do people band together, why do they form groups and cooperate?”

	It was a direct question, not something for Yayati to mull over.  He thought for a while before replying, “Because it grows their strength, makes them stronger?”

	“Yes,” said Nahusha, “But delve deeper, and more into the past.  Think of the first and early men, those that lived in caves and hunted with the most primitive of weapons.  When two early men hunted the same deer, why did they share it, and not fight over it?”

	Yayati thought hard over the question, but could offer no answer.  He took his mind back to the early myths, to stories of the first Manus and their progenies.  But there was nothing in those legends to answer father’s latest query.  This was a question he would have to answer for himself.  “The early man would have had a propensity to share, or to fight and take the whole hunt,” he started, and Nahusha nodded encouragingly.  “At some point, two men must have realized that they had better chance of success if they worked together.  Small groups like this would have met, and found even greater strength and safety in their numbers.”  Yayati felt quite satisfied with himself after that elaboration.

	“Well summated,” said Nahusha approvingly, just as he would say to any scout or military general after receiving the latest campaign report.  “You have finally arrived at the heart of the matter.  Men band together because they are able to share the same code of behavior, the same system of laws and ethics.  They form a contract with each other- a measure of reciprocity, where each gets a greater share than they would alone.  So when you say ‘our land’ and ‘our rivers’, you are talking about the entire group of people that share the same, or at least similar codes of behavior and ethics.  Do you understand this, son?”  

	The question made it obvious that it was important for Yayati to understand, so he nodded silently.  

	“Our land belongs to the Arya, the noble people that rose from nomadism to agricultarism, and finally civilization.  It constitutes all those men who make their lives between the Sindhu and the Ganga, for we all descend from the traditions of the same Maharshis and Maharajas.  The land you thump your chest to so proudly is the land of the Arya, it is the great land of Aryavarta.  This is what Ikshvaku once said to Pururava, who imparted it to my father.”

***

**Year 182, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

 “I care not about rule and power,” countered Yati the elder son, feeling brazen and confident.  He no longer held fear and awe for his father, and his defiant posture said it.  

	“It is not about rule and power,” said Nahusha, “But about responsibility and obligation.  For good or bad, the people place their trust and faith in you- in your dynasty, as they always have.”  The Somavanshi King was both balding and greying now, but his silver-grey soma eyes shone as luminously as ever.  This was a King that had spread his empire far and wide.  Rshis chanted hymns in his name, glorifying his revival of ancient towns along the Sarasvati.  Cowherds and farmers sang to his good health, forever loyal to him for the enormous grants of fertile land he had given them.  Scientists and astronomers deferred to this King, such was his knowledge of all the ancient shastras.  Gandharvas, Vanaras, Rakshasas and Yakshas submitted to his rule, finding greater prosperity for themselves under the patronage of King Nahusha than on their own.  One day, the ballads were singing, King Nahusha would go on to rule the realms of the Devas themselves.  

	But despite all that, his elder son stood in front of him with bold antagonism, denying all the laws of his father, as if it was his birth right.  “It is good fortune then that you have two sons,” the hostile son now said, “For if one fails, the other can succeed you.”  The pun was not intended, but it delivered a pinching blow of arrogance.

	Nahusha sighed, feeling as hurt and weary as his bones were.  He was eighty-three now, blessed enough to have witnessed the birth of five healthy grandsons.  But they had all come from Yayati, his younger son.  Yati the elder gifted him no progeny, and now that Yati neared the age of fifty, it no longer churned hope in Nahusha’s heart that he would deliver him descendants.  But that Yati would renounce Kingship altogether was a thought he had never entertained.

	“Yati,” said Nahusha, trying to bring reason into his voice, “Abdicating one’s responsibilities is a gross violation of the codes we have always lived by.  Is this what you have learnt from the Rshis?”

	“I have learnt nothing from the Rshis,” snapped Yati, casting a pall of silence in the hall.  

	He had gone too far, and he knew it.  King Nahusha sat on his throne, but despite his calm posture, there was the moon blazing behind his eyes.  For a long while neither said anything, and then the King finally spoke in a tempered voice.  “Go then,” he said.  “Go and find your answers for yourself.  But leave my palace and leave my city.  I care not if you find your place right outside Pratisthana, but do not set foot inside it ever again.”

	It was not arrogance but shame that made Yati nod and retreat silently.  He left the Somavansha capital that night, bidding good bye to no one.  In the morning, none knew where the King’s elder son was.  And so it took two days for news to reach Yati that his father had silently passed away in his sleep, the night of his departure from Pratisthana.  Yayati the younger was now Somavanshi King.
