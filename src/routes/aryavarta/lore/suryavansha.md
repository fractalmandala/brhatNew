> When I look to the ancient Kings of fame and legend, I look beyond my own ancestor Bharata to the great and first true King- Ikshvaku.  I have learnt much from him, and I continue to turn to his stories for counsel.  In battle or at home, as a leader of warriors and a ruler of cities- Ikshvaku is my inspiration.  There can be no other man like him, a true scion of the Solar dynasty.<br><cite>King Sudasa to his daughter</cite>

Sudasa could not wait to get home and for Rshi Vasishtha’s stories to recommence.   But trouble was brewing back in King Pijavana’s lands.  The Yadavas’ attacks were increasing in both frequency and intensity, and now they had finally taken control of Yamaprastha- the Bharata outpost on the Yamuna’s eastern banks.  

	“They are strengthened by the Puru presence at Hastinapura,” King Pijavana said with disgust.  He was a man who freely discussed politics and war with his young son.  “Bhuvamanyu supplies them with weapons and men both.”

	“But how does he transport them from Hastinapura to Mathura?”  Sudasa asked.  “Our forces in Bharatpura or Kampilya should be able to intercept them.”

	  “They do, from time to time.  But the land between Ganga and Yamuna is vast, and we cannot spend too many resources on manning both land and river.”

	“Can Uncle Divodasa not help?”  Sudasa asked.  Divodasa’s forces could patrol the lands west of Yamuna, spanning around Bharatpura.  

	“Divodasa has his own troubles for now,” Pijavana said grimly.  “The Dasas, Druhyus and Turvasas continue to penetrate deeper into his borders.  He can spare no men for us.”

	“Are we going to take Yamaprastha back, father?”

	“We must, I cannot let the Yadavas establish a presence so close to Kampilya.  Commander Sankalpa is preparing the forces as we speak.   I ride to battle at the break of first light.”

	“I wish to go with you, father,” Sudasa said.  He wanted to be by the Bharata soldiers’ side, fighting for the land with them.  

	“No,” Pijavana said sternly.  “You are too young, Sudasa.  It is not your time yet.”

	Sudasa knew he could not argue, father had a way of inflecting finality in his tone.  The next morning he watched glumly as the soldiers marched out, with King Pijavana and Commander Sankalpa in the lead.  Lines of horsemen, archers, elephants and chariots paraded down the royal highway leading out of Prayaga.  The reality of it was not lost on Sudasa- he knew that his father might not return from the campaign.  

	That evening Rshi Vasishtha sensed his pupil’s gloom.  “All tribes have their own ways,” he said.  “The Suryavansha allow their children to take the sword early, but that is because they have traditionally lived in more dangerous times and places.  The Bharata can afford better protection than that.”

	Sudasa knew that his guru was right, but the memory of the Aikshvaku warriors in Ayodhya was still fresh in his mind.  If Suryavanshi boys could wade into battle at such young ages, then why couldn’t he?  Suddenly he thought of Ikshvaku, and the stories Vasishtha promised.  “How old was Ikshvaku when he became King, rshi Vasishtha?”  He asked.

	Vasishtha smiled benignly.  “Not too older than you are now.  Do not regret the few more years you have with me, my young pupil,” Vasishtha said.  “Perhaps you may learn something from the history of Aryavarta that other Kings have failed to.  Through the triumphs and mistakes of rulers before you, you can become a better one yourself.  But come, let me grant your wish and tell you of Ikshvaku now.”

**Year 33, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

The town of Avisari was decorated.  Bright streams of cloth ran in weaves between rooftops of multi-storied huts and domes.  Thin, coiled strings in myriad hues hung from the streams and fell to the ground in curls.  Horses stood in pairs, facing each other all along Avisari’s two main, intersecting streets- their faces painted in Solar insignia.  Town criers ran through alleys and connecting pathways, singing of the royal coronation and adding to the din of ceramic trumpets and wooden drums.  The entire town was out on the streets, filling up market places and common areas, making Avisari seem more crowded than usual.  Ornate, processional boats floated along the canals dug from the Sindhu River up to Avisari.  They carried choirs and criers of their own, who zealously blew their trumpets and shouted proclamations to the glory of the First Raja. 

	Haryashva could hear the noise and see bands of colour from the distance, as his horse trundled towards Avisari.  After two months of arduous journey through rough mountain terrain, he had finally reached his destination.  Tired and under-nourished, he was pleased to see the town within sight.  From his direction of approach, the Sindhu sloped away gently towards the right, and then disappeared into the foothills.  Those hills grew steadily in size till, in the backdrop, all around the town one could see tall, imposing peaks covered in snow.  Haryashva made out at least five peaks that were hidden among the clouds.  A two-man party of horsemen approached him when he reached close to Avisari’s main entrance, which led onto a wide, crowded street.  Their horses were smaller, but they appeared fit and well-muscled.  And with bright orange, yellow and red paint on them, they looked far fiercer than his ageing, tired stallion.  When the men reached closer he noticed bright, gleaming swords hanging by the sides.  Then his gaze went to the turrets mounted next to the main gate, where he saw archers standing with their aim pointed ready at him.  

	“Halt rider,” one of the approaching men called out when they were within earshot.  Haryashva horse was already progressing at a casual, slow trot.  He frowned and brought the beast to a complete halt.  His left hand instinctively went to the dagger tucked beneath his robe, though he mused at what good it might do him in case the archers decided to fire.  

	The riders reached him and flanked him on either side.  “Introduce yourself, rider,” one of them commanded.

	Haryashva looked at one and then the other.  “I am Haryashva of the Ashvakas, from Kapisa” he replied.  “I come to submit my clan to the King.”

	“Foreigners cannot enter Avisari today,” one of the riders replied indifferently.

	“And who is a foreigner to you?”  He shot back.  “Are we all not people of Aryavarta, or does the King discriminate among the various tribes?”

	“On this day, you are either a resident of Avisari, or you are not,” the rider replied, impatient now.  “You simply cannot enter.”

	“In any case,” added the second rider, “Who can say whether Kapisa falls in Aryavarta or Harivarsha.  You could be a foreigner for all I care.”  Harivarsha was the continent to Aryavarta’s west, a land of broad basins, fertile plateaus and vast grazing pastures freckled with swathes of arid semi-deserts. 

	“But enter I must,” Haryashva replied stubbornly.  His grip around the dagger tightened, and with a small nudge he brought his horse in front of a rider, so as to hide himself from the aim of the archers.  

	The rider talking to him smiled arrogantly.  “Kapisa is a noble city,” he conceded, “And the Ashvakas are famed horse-warriors.  But you cannot hope to stand the might of Avisari combined, Haryashva of the Ashvakas.  There are a number of inns and shelters around here, including a large village near the river bank.  Take rest there for tonight, and visit Avisari at the break of the Sun tomorrow.”

	Haryashva shook his head in the negative.  “I cannot do that, my friend.  I have travelled long and far for a single purpose.  I must meet the King today, at the earliest.”

	The two riders chuckled and snorted.  “Meet the King?”  One asked incredulously.  “And who are you anyway, Ashvaka?  You think the King has time to meet the likes of you?”

	“We waste time needlessly,” Haryashva said.  “I will gain passage to your city today, and I will meet the King, whether you like it or not.  I bring message that the King needs to hear.”

	“Then you will give the message to his advisor, and you will do so tomorrow.”

	“Again, you fight a lost cause.  Move aside now, riders.  I will gain passage to your town.”

	Haryashva made a move past them, and both riders pulled out their swords with surprising swiftness.  In a flash, Haryashva leaped off his horse and, grabbing hold of one of the riders’ reins, he yanked hard.  In the distance, the archers waved their bows about helplessly, unable to find aim.  The rider fell to the ground with a loud thud and lost grip on his sword.  Haryashva drove his left foot into his plexus, and kicked the sword away as the rider doubled up in pain.  The other rider turned his horse around and bellowed towards Haryashva.  He pulled out his dagger and got into a half-crouched stance.  The Avisarin horses were shorter and smaller, all the more within the range of his swipe.  The rider charged at him, roaring in rage.  As he came close, he slashed his sword at Haryashva.  Staying where he was, Haryashva swayed backwards and slashed his dagger across the galloping horse, cutting deep and long.  The horse neighed in alarm and pain, and nearly knocked his rider off.  But the rider managed to keep it in reins, and turned around for another charge at him.  The other rider had now found his breath and sword.  He slashed wildly, wasting precious air with his long, heavy heaves.  Aiming for his leg, Haryashva kicked hard and knocked him off balance.  Then he felt the back of his skull explode in crucifying pain, and lost consciousness in an instant.

***

He found the pain again just as he found consciousness.  By the time he opened his eyes, his skull was throbbing hard, and his eyes teared up immediately.  His vision was still blurry, and he smelled the metallic tang of dry blood on his face.  He was firmly tied to a wooden post, his arms behind his back.  When he found his orientation, he saw that he was surrounded by a group of men, and a young boy of not more than fifteen.  They were all attired regally, golden sashes running from their left shoulder down, around the right side of the waist.  Under that they sported strong, bronze armour and long, menacing swords dangled at their waists.  All were tall and muscular, including the boy.  His young age was belied only by the smooth, hairless glow of his skin; and the wide, curious look in his eyes- in direct contrast with the others’ grim expressions.

	At a shake of the boy’s head, a soldier walked up to Haryashva and brought a pot of water to his lips.  Haryashva greedily gulped it down, realising all of a sudden that his throat was painfully parched.  He emptied the pot, and the soldier moved away.  Pain was swelling up in different parts of his body now, from his jaw to his left knee.  

	“You gave my city-guard quite a scare, Ashvaka,” the boy said.  “They were in half a mind to chop your head right off.”

	Haryashva found no reply to that, and his throat still hurt.

	“But when I heard of it,” the boy continued, “I decided that there must be a good reason for an Ashvaka to travel all the way from Kapisa, just to visit me.”

	With a start, Haryashva realised that the boy was in fact the King.  His eyes widened with comprehension, who knew that the King was so young?

	“So tell me, stranger,” the boy said, “Why is it that you wanted to meet me?”  He gestured to a soldier again, and someone walked up to Haryashva with a moist cotton swab and cleaned the blood around his temple, chin and jaw with warm water.

	“If this is how the King treats guests to his city,” Haryashva replied in a hoarse, broken voice, “Then he is not a King I want to meet.”  To his surprise, he saw on the boy’s face an expression that was close to contrition.

	“I realise that,” the boy conceded.  “The city-guard was too zealous.  But I do not blame them overmuch.  We have been facing raids from Gandharvas and Rakshasas of late, and their numbers have been growing larger.  Today being my coronation, the city-guard was particularly jumpy.  I would have them untie you now, but even I choose to exercise caution where I can.  Tell me of your intent, Ashvaka, and I will have you rested and refreshed as an honoured guest.  They tell me your name is Haryashva, so you must from an elite Ashvaka line.”

	“As I told your soldiers, young King, I came here to offer you my allegiance.  If you are troubled by Gandharvas and Rakshasas here, then Kapisa faces attacks from Yaksha raiding parties every quarter.  We heard that a ruling warrior dynasty rises in the near east, and I followed the trail that led to you.”

	The boy signalled with his hand.  Another man behind him protested, “But my King!”  The boy waved his hand dismissively, and the man fell silent.  Haryashva found his hands and feet being untied.  He grimaced and brought his wrists out, rotating them around to flex them.  

	“There,” the boy said, “Now tell me all, Haryashva.  What have you heard about my ruling warrior dynasty?”

	“I would like my robe and dagger back,” Haryashva said.  “And I hope my horse is being taken care of.”

	“Your horse is well fed and rested,” the boy assured him.  “I recognise a fine beast when I see one.  You cannot, however, have your dagger back just yet.  My advisors would be scandalised if I was so careless.  Let us talk more, and get to know each other first.  You will notice that I carry no armament myself.”

	“The men around us do,” Haryashva countered.

	The boy sighed.  “Yes they do,” he conceded.  “You are as stubborn as the northern horsemen are said to be, Ashvaka.”  He turned to the men around him and nodded.  Protesting only with their eyes, they slowly filed out of the room.  

	When they were alone, the boy King smiled warmly and gestured to the seating slabs in one side of the room.  “Come, let us sit.  Your feet must be immensely tired.”

	Haryashva warily sat down, and so did the boy.  “These Yakshas you speak of,” the boy began, “Where do they come from?”

	“A bulk of the raiders that come to Kapisa are from the surrounding mountains.  Our spies have confirmed that they have at least six settlements among the valleys.  But the problem is compounded by the fact that every year, hundreds of Yakshas arrive from the far-east.”

	The boy nodded thoughtfully.  “We’ve noticed increased migrations from that side too.  Numbers are on the rise everywhere, ours as well as theirs.  But that still doesn’t explain what brought you here, Haryashva.  How can we help you?”

	Haryashva looked at him blankly.  “You are a King,” he replied, “A leader of men.  You are said to have up to a thousand soldiers in your sena.  And the Yaksha encroachments threaten the borders of Aryavarta itself, surely that is a threat to your nascent Kingdom?”

	Again the boy nodded thoughtfully, and the deep look in his eyes told Haryashva that he was much wiser than he looked.  “I appreciate your logic, Haryashva,” the boy said.  “But we have troubles of our own here.  How can I defend Aryavarta, when I have no Aryavarta to rule over?  It is downstream, along the Sarasvati and Sindhu, that I must look to first.  And I have not even started yet, my official coronation is only today!”

	“But you have much to gain from helping us.  Even half your total sena would be enough to eradicate the Yaksha settlements, once and for all.  And in return, we will offer our own horsemen to your sena.  Ashvaka’s stallions are the finest war-bred horses in all Aryavarta, and Ashvakas are experts in the arts of equine warfare.  Our numbers will strengthen yours.”

	“Ashvaka cavalry would indeed make my sena quite formidable,” the boy admitted.  “And it would make it easier to patrol the banks of Sindhu with your faster, stronger horses.  But I will not decide on this before consulting with my advisors.  And for that, we will have to wait till we are done with the coronation.”

	“Time is of the essence,” Haryashva warned.  “We must strike before more Yakshas arrive from the far-east and fortify their existing settlements.”

	“I understand,” the boy replied.

	There was an awkward silence before Haryashva confessed, “I had expected you to be older.”

	The boy did not appear to take offence to that.  “I had expected to be older myself,” he said, “But the people would not have it.  They seem to want their King right now.”

	Haryashva was warmed by the boy’s candour.  “I have heard that you claim divine descent from Surya himself,” he said.

	“And so I do,” the boy said proudly.  “My forefathers were from the line of Surya the Last, or Havishmana- as some say he was called.”

“I have also heard about this figure- the Vaivasvat Manu.”

	“He is my father,” the boy said, “And his birth name was Kshuva.”

	“Why would the Vaivasvat Manu not crown himself King?”  Haryashva asked.

	“Vaivasvat Manu has larger roles to play,” Ikshvaku answered.  “He is the Great Progenitor, and his duty is to spread his clan and enlarge its numbers.  The banks of Sindhu and Sarasvati are replete with villages set up under his care and guidance.”

	“But such growing numbers need protection,” Haryashva said, finally seeing how father and son played two different, but vital roles.

	“Yes, and they need men willing to die for that protection.  They need weapon and metal, horse and authority.  A mere Chieftain cannot wield such power, he cannot rally an army around him.  But a King can.”

	“Certainly one descended from Surya himself,” Haryashva added.

	“Indeed,” the boy-King replied.
