> There is place for only one tribe in Aryavarta.  Even the Suryavansha must be ousted one day, there is no other way.  The borders of Bharatvarsha must become congruous with those of Aryavarta.<br><cite>King Sudasa Bharata to his infantry</cite>

“Finally, our time comes to an end,” Rshi Vasishtha said, his deep voice rising over the cackling fire.  The rivers blew a frigid breeze that fought the fire with intensity.  Their robes fluttered, as did their hair, but both master and pupil sat with their backs perfectly straight, their rigid frames stationary.

	“I know,” Sudasa said gloomily.  A day ago, King Pijavana informed Sudasa that he was to depart for Ayodhya.  This was his last evening with the Rshi.  “But there is still so much to know.”

	Rshi Vasishtha nodded in agreement.  “There is always more to know, young one, and never forget that.  Knowledge is a process, a perennial journey.  Do not mistake it for a finite entity.”

	Sudasa bowed his head in acceptance.  Only seventeen years of age, the young boy braved the cold elements with immunity equal to his mentor.  His body was already toned by years of meditational exercises under the care of Rshi Vasishtha.  Now that fit, pliable frame would be sculpted into one of muscle and strength by none other than the Suryavanshi.  Vasishtha was pleased for his pupil- his five years in Ayodhya promised an education Vasishtha could never provide.  

	“As for our itihasa,” Vasishtha said, “There is no reason we cannot continue the tale during your visits home.  But where did we stop last time?”

	It was a test, not an indication of failure in the rshi’s memory.  “The Yadavas and rebel Dasas were about to pit their full strength against Vitabhya,” Sudasa answered.

	“Yes, Dharma Haihaya and the Dasa Dhritaspa marched into Vitabhya with their forces united.  King Prithu and the Suryavansha fought them bravely, young one.  But eventually the battle did not run to their favour, even with the warriors sent by King Janaka.  Prithu lost, and Vitabhya went to the Yadavas.  The Suryavansha was forced back north of Kamyakvana- confined to the four cities of Navapari, Divyakuta, Avisari and Kapisa.”

	“And what of Aneni, guruji?”

	Rshi Vasishtha gave his pupil a sad sigh.  “Aneni is lost to us from then on.  Dhritaspa became the new Zarath Ustra, and the best of King Prithu’s spies could not determine the location or fate of Aneni.  Prithu died a broken, weary man, ridden with guilt at having lost the Kingdom of his forefathers.”

	Sudasa’s eyes were glazed in thought, before he asked, “How did the Suryavansha go from that defeated tribe to the powerful one centered at Ayodhya today, guruji?”

	Rshi Vasishtha’s eyes widened and he smiled.  “Yes, that is quite the question.  The Suryavanshi are a mighty force, and nothing has ever been able to keep them down.  But to answer your query, I would have to tell you of their King Mandhatra- five generations after Prithu.  I would have to tell you of Mandhatra’s assault on the Puru tribe, and how he all but wiped them out- thus carving a place for his descendants right on the Ganga-Yamuna plains.”

	“Then tell me, guruji,” Sudasa insisted.  He would never tire of listening to tales of the Suryavansha, he was certain of that.  

	“I will,” Vasishtha promised, “But not today.  This will be the prologue to the tale of First King Bharata, but five years from now.  Today, the last tale I want to give you is that of King Bahu- Suryavanshi King who lost Ayodhya to the Yadavas.  Bahu was father to Sagara, who in turn is grandfather to King Bhagiratha.  The Yadavas could never hold Ayodhya, of course- the land and the river were too hostile to them.  And so in a few years after conquering it from Bahu, the Yadavas abandoned it.  To that abandoned, ancient capital, King Bhagiratha led his people back- three generations later. 

***

**Year 785, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

Standing tall and erect on the balcony, King Bahu of Ayodhya observed his sons as they trained among the soldiers.  At the age of fifty two, he was confident that he had produced a strong and capable lineage, which would revive the power and glory of the Suryavansha.  Of course, Bahu himself had to withstand one last test before he could step down.  The King of Ayodhya- descendant of Ayudha the founder, and Mandhatra before him, clenched his jaws and fist as he thought of the final battle he had to conduct.

	“The princes are to be kept away from battle,” Bahu commanded.  Beside him, Sagara- the Senapati and his eldest son, nodded solemnly.  “Make sure all of them know the routes from here to Mithila and beyond.”

	“It will be done, father,” said Senapati Sagara.  Twenty-eight years old, Sagara had already aided his father for ten years now.  Together, he and Bahu had expanded on the achievements of Kings Ayudha and Kosala.  Ayodhya was one of the largest cities in Aryavarta, populated by more than twelve thousand people.  The original four walls stood only ceremoniously, a reminder of the city’s humble but proud beginnings.  Ayodhya now spread over both sides of the Sarayu River.  Old Ayodhya was the home of the old families, noblemen and warrior clans that traced their lineages back to the first Suryavanshi family lines.  Its well-planned roads and avenues were lined with some of the oldest markets and trading places, this side of the Gomati.  New Ayodhya was a nexus of renewed spiritual frenzy.  Rshi clans of all geographies and lineages mingled in an easy tolerance that was absent among the cities of the Grand Bharata Kingdom.  Nascent groups found space in Ayodhya as well, migrating from the northern city of Mithila once Ayodhya developed into a truly urban conglomeration.  There were some Dravida Rshis too- travelers from the southern reaches of Aryavarta, beyond the Kingdom of the Haihayas.  Others found their way to Ayodhya from beyond the hill ranges that lined Aryavarta’s entire eastern coastline.      

	And all of that had to be preserved, Bahu reiterated to himself.  The Haihaya army had already made its way through Vaishali, King Suchandra and his men were dead, and the citizens under Haihaya rule.  Now, the main enemy force was not more than two days away from Kosala, the southern outpost.  From Kosala, an army on battle-march would take less than a day to reach the gates of Ayodhya.  Bahu thought of the old Kings, starting from Ikshvaku himself.  Suryavanshi rulers had established a tradition of being trapped within the gates of their city.  But that was not to be his fate.  He would meet the Haihaya force on the plains between Ayodhya and Kosala, defending the great city from outside.  If Ayodhya was to be unconquerable, then its soldiers had to be the first line of defence.

“How many?” Senapati Sagara asked.

	“Two thousand on foot, five hundred elephants and a hundred horsemen,” the scout replied smartly.

	Sagara smiled without humour.  The scout from a day before reported three thousand on foot, and a thousand elephants.  Sagara suspected that the Haihaya King, Bhadri, would divert part of his army to find a way across the Sarayu and attack Ayodhya’s older, walled region.  To defend against that, he posted contingents of archers on all the crossing points on the Sarayu.  They would only buy him some time though, he would have to send a proper contingent- once the Haihayas’ chosen point of crossing was identified.  Till then, he needed all the men he could get to defend the western borders of new Ayodhya.

	“Send word to the King,” Sagara said to an aide, “The battle is only a few hours away.”

	The aide bowed and departed swiftly.  Sagara signaled, and his charioteer brought forward the golden-ochre armour, second in glory only to the King’s.  It carried the royal Suryavanshi design, with spiked shoulder pads and helmet, flexible at the elbows- where the separate plates were joined by a folded, silver sheet.  The same design existed at the knees, and the boots carried short, stubby spikes, both at the front and the back.  Senapati Sagara donned his armour and exited the tent to find his horse waiting.  He mounted it and made way for his chariot, ready for war.

***

King Bahu shouted out above the din, “Take a small unit and fan out, find those savages!”  He saw Sagara nod slightly and disappear among the melee of fighting soldiers and animals.  Bahu heaved his own sword out of the slain Haihaya soldier and continued fighting, licking and wiping the blood off his face.  The Haihayas had brought Rakshasas to the party, it seemed.  It had been generations since Suryavanshi armies battled Rakshasas- for King Ayudha and his sons cleansed the forest of them long ago.  Their wild and chaotic style of war was completely new to Bahu and his men.  They wreaked havoc among his well-planned formations, swinging spiked metal balls that were held by barbed chains.  The weapons slashed viciously through lines of men, gutting and cutting them just before Haihaya soldiers stepped in with swords and shields.  

	On the other side of the battlefield, elephants from both sides clashed hard and brutal.  Their angry and deadly blares added an unending, deafening din to the battle.  Bahu continued slashing and swinging his sword, expertly cutting through Haihaya soldiers.  He let them come to him, and there was no shortage of ambitious Haihaya soldiers, eager to slay the Suryavanshi King himself.  They were rash and untrained, and Bahu knew that these were men that Bhadri had gathered from the remote villages around Girivraja, Dantipura and Vishvapuri.  Hastily assembled, his army appeared unmistakably tentative.  But the marauding Rakshasa bands more than balanced that equation.

	He heard a warning call, and looked back to see another Rakshasa running towards him, swinging the metal ball.  Bahu eyed left and right to find a way out of the swinging arcs.  The Haihaya soldiers backed off too, happy to let the Rakshasas do the job.  He heard his own men calling to him, asking their King to find cover.  Bahu angrily licked some blood off his lips and roared.  He narrowed his gaze, primed his sword and began running towards the attacking line.  The Rakshasa increased his speed, surprised by Bahu’s run towards him.  Bahu kept his eye on the swinging ball, calculating its arc and distance from him.  Around them, the other marauding Rakshasas stopped, their gaze on the two men rushing at each other.  One a wild Rakshasa, confidently swinging his weapon.  The other a Suryavanshi King, his blade gleaming under the afternoon sun- Patron to his dynasty. 

	Age had not begun wearing Bahu’ bones yet.  He was a man at the peak of his health and experience.  At just the right moment, Bahu leaped into the air and curled his legs up.  The ball’s chain angrily whooshed past below him a split-second before he landed back on his feet and rolled along the ground.  He had time to jump ahead to his right and leap back into the air when the chain swung past below him again.  This time, Bahu continued to roll along the ground to his right, and the chain swung past way over him- the Rakshasa having swung it higher in anticipation of another leap.  But before the next swing could come along, Bahu had made his way right to the Rakshasa.  The Suryavanshi King slashed his sword cleanly across the Rakshasa’s wrist, and the disembodied hand flew away along with the chain and ball.  The Rakshasa’s agonized roar was abruptly cut short when Bahu’s next swing removed the head from the body.

	All around him, the Suryavanshi soldiers roared in triumph and charged towards the enemy.  The remaining Rakshasas had no time to start swinging their weapons again, and met the same fate as their comrade.  King Bahu allowed himself a grim moment of satisfaction.  They had survived this wave at least.  But if the Rakshasa waves kept coming, then Ayodhya would be unable to spare the units manning the river crossings.

“What news?”  Demanded Sanjay, Suryavanshi Ruler of Sravasti.  

	“The battle outside Ayodhya rages on, my King,” informed the scout.  “King Bahu and Senapati Sagara are at the head of the Ayodhyan defence.  But another contingent of the Haihaya army has found a point across the Sarayu, north of Ayodhya.  The Ayodhyan army cannot sustain a battle on two fronts for long.”

	“What of the contingent we sent to flank the Haihayas from their west?”  Sanjay asked.

	“The men are fighting bravely, but the Haihaya cavalry is giving them a tough time.  They have been unable to breach their formations.”

	“Send more,” Sanjaya said without hesitation.  He had two whole contingents camped at the northern end of the forests, north-west of Ayodhya.  With so many men set to Ayodhya’s defence, Sravasti itself was vulnerable to attack.  The city had a modest force camped in it, the rest guarded the river crossing to the south, which was the only way across the Sarayu for yojanas around.  Just as Bahu and he had long suspected they would, the Haihayas found their way across the Ganga through the forests between Kashi and Girivraja, building temporary bridges and boats with wood collected from the trees along the river bank.  Now they had crossed the Sarayu as well.  Sanjay thought of his cousin, King Bahu of Ayodhya, who even now would be amid the heat of battle.  

***

The sun, patron deity of his dynasty, passed beyond the horizon, leaving a pale-orange hue in the sky.  The crescent moon was hidden behind sparse clouds, but the stars were shining bright and vivid.  Bahu’s limbs ached miserably, and the easy confidence of the afternoon had been replaced by a dazed, numb weariness where only training and instinct kept him going.  Enemy soldiers were inside and outside his city on both sides, running through the streets and slaying common folk without restrain.  His military mind knew that the battle was not yet lost.  The enemy was only in certain sections of the city, and his men had held it back there from strategically placed outposts.  Reinforcements rode in from Sravasti, once it became clear that the entire Haihaya attack was concentrated singularly on Ayodhya.  The rest of his mind thought of the innocent people dying to Haihaya swords, and the more that would die before the tide of the battle could be turned.  

	He slashed his sword in annoyance, and hacked into the torso of the attacking Haihaya, who cried out in terror and pain.  Bahu let his sword stick in and dragged the man closer from his shoulder, allowing the sword to go deeper and deeper.  The man’s eyes were wide in agony, hazed by the look of a man who knew that it was his time to meet death.  

	“You will not take my city,” Bahu whispered into the dying ears, before cleanly slicing his sword back out and letting the man fall to the ground.  

***

The King favored his feet, choosing to lead among the infantry.  But Senapati Sagara was a horse and chariot man, more a strategist and tactician on the field of battle than a swordsman who went by the swing of his blade.  For generations, the Suryavanshi had produced the best among both, and Senapati Sagara was as good as his father.  The Haihayas had crossed the Sarayu, but Sagara was making sure that each enemy soldier fought for his life before his feet touched the Sarayu’s eastern bank. 

	“Keep shooting,” he urged the archers.  Slightly ahead of them, the infantry was clashing against the enemy men getting beyond Sagara and his horsemen.  He knew that he could rally the men here only for so long.  Soon, he would have to turn his attention to the Haihayas who had found their way inside the city.  On the opposite bank, the enemy began congregating in large numbers.  They established tents and camps, lighting up torches and sticking them into the ground.  It was a daunting sight for the Ayodhyan soldier on this side of the river.  Sagara knew what his men would be thinking- that this battle would never end, and the enemy would keep coming.  He turned the wheels inside his head, he had to do something that would change the tide of battle.

***

The King observed his military commanders, five in all.  They were all men who feared him, who delivered to him everything he wanted- with no allowance for failure.  But now they stood before him with their heads bowed, none of them in possession of the answers he wanted.

	“Why is this taking so long?”  He asked calmly.  In the King’s case, a calm and tempered tone was more ominous than a raged one.  During moments of patience, this King cultivated the best plans of punishment for failure.

	None dared give the right answer- it was taking so long because of the courageous defence the Suryavanshi had mounted.  They had lesser men, but far greater expertise and ability.  But anyone who said this to the King was marked for death.  

	The King knew this.  “How long before we can get more men?”  He asked.

	This time the answer was easy, so one of the commanders replied quickly, “In less than half a day, my King.  The first set of reinforcements is already on the way.”

	The King approved of that.  This man would be spared his life.  But he had to kill one of them today, or they would continue to get complacent.  Who among the remaining four then?  “Why was the Sravasti reinforcement not anticipated?”  He asked, again calm and composed.

	“It was, my King,” replied another commander.  “We were able to reduce its strength by a third, even before it could aid the defence of Ayodhya.”

	The King’s lips curved ever so slightly.  This commander was a smart one, knowing how to coat grim news positively.  He would like to keep this one around for a while longer.  Three remaining now, and one of them had to die.  King Bhadri was already planning how he would kill the unfortunate one, while he asked his next question.

***

This was the Sarayu, life giver to his people and their lands.  It would favour him over an enemy that did not respect it and care for it.  Sagara grunted and pushed his way through the muddy riverbed, his feet sinking further in with every step.  Pretty soon he was swimming, his men behind him, and arrows raining all around them.  The plan had appealed to the courage of his men, and so there were more than enough volunteers.  It was a grim but true military fact- their only chance was in numbers, numbers that had to survive through attrition.  Sagara ignored the shouts of men behind him as they were pierced by arrows, knowing in the corner of his determined mind that in their last moments, their leader was abandoning them.  But he told himself that they were commanded to do the same in return, if he was hit, and so he was no different than any soldier on this mission.

	Somehow, enough of them were able to swim up to the bridge’s planks.  They brought out their swords and began sawing through them, even as more arrows rained down from above.  If they could destroy the bridge, the Haihayas would have to wait till sunrise to build another.  This would buy Ayodhya some more time.  But a corner of Sagara’s mind wondered- till when?  He refused to accept that the city was lost, and kept sawing.  Men continued to die around him, brave men of Ayodhya, but death was sparing him for now.  It was after several moments of sawing that he realized two things.  One, that the sword was doing very little damage to the thick, strong wood. Two, that the enemy had stopped firing arrows at them, and begun laughing out loud at their feeble attempts to stem the flow.

	Senapati Sagara looked around him.  The enemy had his men completely surrounded, from on top of the bridge, across both river banks, and also in the river itself.  Archers had their arrows primed at him and each of his men, ready to give them all death at the same instant.  He did a quick calculation, less than twenty men stood alive.  Only a few hours ago Sagara commanded more than five hundred men, and now this was all that remained.  He spotted a squat, brutish warrior stepping forward from the enemy line in the river, a malicious grin on his face.

	“The formidable Senapati of the Suryavanshi army, son of King Bahu the great!” he shouted mockingly.  “Standing defeated and lost.  I would have saved you this foolish attempt, Senapati.  Your King has already escaped, leaving the city and its people undefended.  Ayodhya now belongs to the Haihayas, and the Suryavanshi are ousted from the Ganga-belt forever.  Go now, and follow your father.  Return when you think you can give us a fight.”
