> I am lost without an answer to this, acharya.  There is no credibility to the name of Karusaka here.  Among the brothers of Ikshvaku his named is remembered last, and sometimes not even listed.  What do I do?  How do I venture out of this forest and find people who accept my rule?  There are Purus, Bharatas and Yadavas all around us.  My people will be decimated by them in a flash.”<br><cite>King Kuru to his guru Shukracharya</cite>


After King Janmejaya’s revelations, Kaushika noticed several similarities between the Kuru and the Bharata.  Their weapon designs and military formations were of a kind he easily recognized as early Bharata.  Many words in their dialect were directly borrowed from the one prevalent in Kampilya.  And Kaushika could ignore that the Kuru eyes were often dark-brown like the Bharata, including King Janmejaya’s.  

	Kurukshetra was not their only establishment- they had another settlement far deeper in the forest, Rohitaka.  Janmejaya sent his son Bhimsena to accompany Kaushika to Rohitaka- which was three days’ ride on the cleared path the Kurus had constructed between their two towns.  Crown-prince Bhimsena was twenty-one, sported the same face-paint design as his father, and it was impossible to distinguish between the two.  Both had hair of the same length and colour, and cut their beards in the same manner.  Only when Bhimsena spoke could an unlikeness be detected.  His voice was distinctly younger, and he spoke in a more measured tone than his father.  

	“Rohitaka was built ninety years ago by my great-grandfather, Avikshit,” he informed Kaushika on the journey through Khandakvana.  “Our ancestor Kuru migrated back to the north in his old age, taking two of his three sons along with him.  He left Karusaka the Second behind, and Avikshit was descended from that line.”

	Kaushika asked the one question that was foremost on his mind, ever since King Janmejaya revealed the Kuru ancestry to him.  “If Kuru and his line is descended from Samvarna Bharata, then why have the Kuru never claimed the throne?  Why do you still live in the forest, hidden?”

	“Because we await the fulfillment of Bhrigu’s prophecy,” Bhimsena replied, so quickly that Kaushika wondered whether he was ready for the question.  “Not the Maharshi, but a descendant who was spiritual preceptor to Kuru.  Rshi Bhrigu prophesized that one day, the Grand Bharata Kingdom would have need of Samvarna and his sons.  If the Kuru reveal themselves before that, the result would only be war and discord, for which Bharata King would relent his throne to us?  But if we shout our names out at the right time, at the time when every hand and sword will be needed, then there can only be alliance and mutual victory.”

	That was planning on a level Kaushika had never heard of.  Most Kings were rarely able to think of a generation or two beyond them, not counting grandiose dreams of wide, dynastic empires.  But here was a tribe that was working on a scenario hatched no less than six generations ago!  The Kuru had definitely not inherited this aspect from the Bharata.  There were moments when he was tempted to reveal his true lineage- that of a prince from Kaushambhi, brother to King Vishvaratha.  This was the line of Jahnu, younger son of Suhotra, who was in turn First King Bharata’s firstborn.

	The journey to Rohitaka was far smoother and uneventful than Kaushika expected.  The path was wide and well-laid with enough clearings along the way for carts and caravans to make rest.  Contingents of warriors manned it at regular intervals, guarding against predators, robbers and Rakshasas.  Prince Bhimsena was easily recognized by the warriors and other travelers, and he responded to their greetings with equal parts command and cordiality.  Kaushika continued to wonder at how the Kuru were running a full-fledged Kingdom inside Khandakvana, unbeknownst to those outside.  

	“What happened to the sons of Kuru who went back north with him?”  Kaushika asked Bhimsena on the second day of journey.  

	“Karuvaka and Bahlika,” Bhimsena replied.  “King Kuru did not want to lose his territories in Dvishani, and with the power and men he acquired in Aryavarta, he was able to extend dominion over Aspasoi as well.  Karuvaka took over his lands around Dvishani- starting the tribe we call Uttarkuru.  The Bahlikas now control Aspasoi and several other lands that once belonged to the Shakas.”

	For the first time in his life Kaushika, speculated on lands beyond the borders of Aryavarta.  He had heard the names of Dvishani and Aspasoi, but he possessed no further knowledge of them.  But Kuru’s decision to retire in Dvishani, and leave Aryavarta to his son, was proof of the fact that there was relevance and meaning even outside Aryavarta.  Kaushika decided to commit this insight to his memory.

**Year 662, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

“If it is legitimacy you seek, then I’m afraid I would be of little help,” said the old rshi.  “Not many remember the name of Bhrigu or Bhargava.”

	“But I do,” Kuru asserted.  His search for a Bhargava had taken several years- no other Rshi School would accept him.  But Kuru had come to realize that a Bhrigu was what he truly needed all along.  “I know that the name predates anything that currently finds claim in Aryavarta.  I know that without Maharshi Bhrigu, there would not have been a Maharshi Kashyapa.  And in turn, there would never have been a Maharshi Vasishtha.  The Soma and Agni that the Bharatas subscribe to were Bhrigu’s deities.”

	Rshi Shukra smiled softly, his moist eyes twinkling in the forest’s darkness.  “Trying to flatter me will not work, young Manava.”  But he found an allure in this young man wishing to be his pupil.  There was no arrogance in eyes, no misplaced feeling of superiority that had become common in men of Arya birth.  

	“Do not call me Manava, Rshi Shukra,” Kuru said.  “I will not subscribe to the tribe of Manu.  When Ikshvaku exiled his brothers, they lost the right to call themselves Manava.  They never called themselves Manushya after that, and the Purus and Bharatas have always used Purusha.”

	“Then what is the name of your tribe?”  Shukra asked.

	“I am the founder and patron of my tribe,” Kuru replied without any vanity.  “After me, my sons will be called the Kuru.  There is no need for us to take the name of those who exiled us.”

	Rshi Shukra relented, and so names of Bhargava and Kuru were united.  King Kuru finally had the ritual backing of a priest family.  Now he could begin building his Kingdom in the heart of Aryavarta.  Rshi Shukra’s first task was to officiate the establishment of Kuru’s capital.  The names Kurupura and Kaurava were discussed, but in the end Rshi Shukra said- “What you build here is no ordinary town.  This will be a place of birth and genesis, a temenos for the Kuru.  I name it Kurukshetra.”

	The Bhargava rshi did have some friends among other Rshi Schools- Atri being the most prominent.  An Atri rshi was present at Kurukshetra’s laying ceremony, adding his voice to the chorus of hymns praying for sanctity and prosperity among the Kuru.  

“Theirs is the true blood of Vaivasvat Manu,” Shukra said to his colleague, after the ceremony.  “Flaming eyes of the yellow sun, bronzed skin and burnt, long hair.  It would seem that Kuru’s claim of being the descendant of Karusaka is true indeed.”

	Rshi Atri scoffed.  “The wild tribes beyond Kapisa and Dvishani are littered with these features,” he said dismissively.  “The blood of Vaivasvat Manu migrated far and wide, we all know this.  Your support for their claim of Manu blood is why so many rshis have abstained from coming.”

	“But there is more,” said Shukra insistently.  “Kuru knows of all the prayers and hymns that Maharshis Kashyapa and Vasishtha composed.  These prayers could not have descended to him, if his blood was not true.  He knows and respects my Bhargava lineage, if that matters for anything.”

	Rshi Atri nodded thoughtfully at that.  “You are firm in your decision to align your house with this man,” he said, not posing it as a question.

	“I am,” Shukra replied.  “I cannot deny a certain similarity between him and me.  We are both men seeking to revive our dying, forgotten lineages.”

	Rshi Atri placed a hand on his friend’s shoulder.  “I am not too different,” he said.  “The Atri School has placed its hopes on Hastina Puru, with aspirations similar to yours.”

	“There you have it then,” Shukra said.  “We are both men of waning seer lineages, and we need the legitimacy of a royal dynasty, just as much as they need ours.  I really do believe that Kuru is the blood of Vaivasvat Manu, returned to Aryavarta.  And while I do not have as much against the Bharatas as you might, even I will agree that the line of Manu has far greater claim to this land than the line of Maharaja Bharata.”

***

“Again!”  Kuru barked at his sons.  “You will not stop until you have perfected it!”

	The three Kauravas resumed their training, following the exact sequence of attacks and parries they had learnt for the day.  Kuru was a relentless teacher, forcing his boys into training from morning to sundown.

	“Your hands are free without a sword,” he said to his sons as they practiced.  “There is no need to hold a piece of metal and pretend that it is a part of your body.  Use your hands as weapons, slicing and jabbing with an accuracy that will surprise your opponent.”

	Skada circled the boys with him, prodding with his stick to straighten their postures and movements.  Karusaka was the eldest, born of Kuru’s union with a maiden in Bharatpura, close to fifteen years ago.  The younger sons Karuvaka and Bahlika were offspring from matrimonial alliances with Rakshasa tribes.  

	“In a way,” Rshi Shukra once said to him, “The blood of a Rakshasa has greater legitimacy than the blood of the Bharatas.  Maharaja Bharata was from Gandhara, while the Rakshasas have always been indigenous to Aryavarta.  Of course, no self-respecting rshi or royal lineage would cede claim to Rakshasa blood.  If you want your sons to be accepted as Kings in Aryavarta, then you need a crutch to stand on, something that would give the Kuru name a licitness greater than what Karusaka’s can.  Karusaka was only an exiled son of Vaivasvat Manu after all, he was never a ruler or King.”

	Khandakvana was not nearly as intimidating to them as it once was.  Now it was home to their growing tribe.  People had been migrating into Khandakvana from Dvishani, Aspasoi, Kapisa and other places for close to a decade.  Word of Kuru had spread far and wide among the fringe tribes outside the borders of Aryavarta.  They would come in bands of anywhere between twenty and two hundred, bringing innumerable dialects, conflicts and cultures with them.  The first few years after the migrations started were the toughest.  Not only did Kuru have to establish his leadership over every new tribe and chieftain that arrived, he had to expend too much time and resources on simply keeping the tribes in line.  

	The migrants had no idea of the political dynamics of Aryavarta, which they called only Bharatvarsha.  They knew not of the internal strife between Puru and Bharata, Bharata and Yadava, Yadava and Suryavansha and Puru and Kuru.  A constant watch had to be kept on them to ensure they did not stray out of Khandakvana, and into Puru or Bharata territory.  Treaties had to be brokered between them and the Rakshasas they co-existed with.  But despite the entry of these foreigners, and despite his matrimonial alliances, it were the Rakshasas that worried Kuru the most.  He had heard several stories of how Ikshvaku and Pururava cleansed Kamyakvana and Khandakvana respectively of the Rakshasas.  The Purus and Bharatas did not even find them worthy of consideration, and most of Aryavarta believed that the Rakshasas were a dying tribe stuck in the Naimisharanya.

	But that was all false.  While the Suryavansha, Yadava, Puru and Bharata fought among themselves, the Rakshasas slowly crept back into the forests and mountains of Aryavarta.  They numbered in thousands in Khandakvana alone, and without a matrimonial alliance, Kuru and his people would have been at their complete mercy.  They had picked up enough culture from the Suryavansha and Puru to know the importance of rshis and royals.  Now there were Rakshasa rshis and dynasties.  They had somehow found descent from Maharshi Kashyapa himself, and there were rulers among them from the prime lines of Maharshi Kashyapa.  Kuru often found himself wishing that the new Rakshasa conglomerate and the Grand Bharata Kingdom come into conflict and destroy each other, thereby not only giving him complete control over Khandakvana, but also ridding Aryavarta of its singular greatest ruling power.  Only his memory of Samvarna, and the few weeks they had spent together, prevented Kuru from outright animosity towards the Bharatas.  

	The Bharata King Samvarna was injured beyond recovery when Kuru found him.  The handful of weeds and herbs in Kuru’s possession had given Samvarna two more weeks of life than his wounds would have allowed him.  Kuru spent most of those two weeks by Samvarna’s bedside, tending to the man and his soul as he would have his own father’s.  It was in those two weeks that Kuru learnt of Aryavarta’s political scenario, its several tribes and the forgotten, renascent status of the Suryavansha.  

	Kuru’s sons continued to practice late into the evening, till their father called them to stop.  He gathered his sons around him and Skada joined them.  He looked at them proudly, surveying the blood of Manu manifested through him.  “Well done,” he said to them.  “I can see from your lithe, strong bodies how you have imbibed the training I have given to you.  Take a bath before you meet Rshi Shukra for your Vedic lessons, but listen to what I have to say first.”

	Eyes glowed at them from the darkness of the forest, and Kuru knew that they belonged to tigers.  But these tigers had encountered his tribe before, and now they knew to keep away.  They surveyed from the darkness, wondering in their animal minds when would they be rid of the constant human presence in their habitat.  

	“Our great ancestor, Vaivasvat Manu, fathered several children- more than those recorded,” Kuru said to his sons. “Most of that blood stayed in Aryavarta, but a lot of it was scattered out too.  There are names among the lands far west of Aspasoi that would sound familiar to the Manu.  There are deities across the oceans that are prayed to, because a descendant of the Manu brought their worship there.  I too wish to spread my name like my ancestor once did, but for that I need you boys.”

	Kuru’s sons stared back at him, unsure of where their father was going with this.  He continued, “I come from Dvishani, and I have ties even in Aspasoi and Harautii.  The name of Kuru can still rally many men in the regions outside Aryavarta.  I do not wish to let that strength go unyoked.  I can stay only in one place myself, but I have been blessed with three strong sons.”

	Skada shifted uncomfortably, knowing what was to come.  He had grown quite fond of Kuru’s sons, coming to love the title of Uncle that they bestowed upon him.  He had already expressed his opposition to Kuru’s decision.  But Kuru was the chief here, the head of the clan.  Skada knew that from the day he followed Kuru into Aryavarta.  

	“Karusaka,” Kuru said to the son he had named after his ancestor, “You will stay here and continue the line with me.  The Kuru has a claim on Aryavarta as valid as that of any other tribe, and you will help me assert that claim.”  Then he turned to the second son and said, “Karuvaka, you must take control of my inheritance in Dvishani.  The name of Kuru must not be forgotten in the land where my father was born, and where he died.”

	Finally Kuru turned to his youngest son, the fifteen year old Bahlika.  “My son,” he said, “Some will say that I am throwing you to the wolves.  But that is the advantage open to a father with three sons.  He can cast his dice in all directions, and I must use you as a vital die.  You are to go to Aspasoi, as my official representative in the Shaka tribal confederation.  They will not accept you before you are twenty, but I have already made arrangements for your care and stay till then.  I will need you to depart immediately, before the winter sets in.  There is nothing I can give in return to you for imposing what is essentially an exile from Aryavarta.  But the least I can do is not impose my name on you.  I leave you free to start your own tribe in Aspasoi, if you so desire.  But it is your duty to ensure that the will of the Kuru is always represented among the Shakas.”

**Year 672, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

Kuru lay in the mud, soiled and bloodied much like he once found Samvarna.  The tigers had tried to rip through to his heart, but even three of them together could not evade the fury of his quick blade slashing through their flesh.  By the time they ran away though, they had done enough damage for Kuru’s wounds to be irreversible.  He was close to death when the worried faces of Skada and Rshi Shukra swam into his blurry vision.

	“Tigers!”  Skada said angrily, even as he helplessly examined his King’s wounds.  Rshi Shukra bent over, and immediately began crushing some dry herbs onto the many cuts and slashes on Kuru’s body.  

	“It is no use,” Kuru murmured weakly.  “I am headed for the other world.”

	Fat, bold tears ran down Skada’s eyes, and he knew that Kuru was right.  He wept disconsolately, and pulled Kuru into a bear hug.  Pain ran through every nerve, but Kuru did not protest.  “Acharya,” Kuru called out to Shukra, using the dialect of Dvishani to refer to his teacher.  “Great Shukracharya, I am in need of your blessings and prayers.”

	Shukracharya’s eyes were moist as well, though he was trying hard to keep a brave face.  Kuru was like a son to him, and no father could bear seeing his son dying such.  “The Devas will guide you well, my son.  They will carry your soul to the stars and beyond.”

	“Do not let them know I died like this,” Kuru pleaded as he coughed some blood and winced in pain.  “Tell them I went away in retirement- to Dvishani or Aspasoi maybe.  And remind my sons never to take the name of Manu, remind them…”  Those were his last words.  Skada wept late into the night, refusing to let go of Kuru’s bloody corpse.  Shukracharya stood by his side, chanting dark and grim prayers not familiar among the tribes of Bharata or Suryavansha.  

	The next day Skada was a different man, taking strong command of a tribe suddenly without a King.  The people did not doubt the story of Kuru’s silent departure to Dvishani- delivered as it was by Shukracharya.  Preparations were made swiftly, and Karusaka the Second was crowned new King of the Kuru.  Word was sent to both Dvishani and Aspasoi- and the Uttarkuru were told to expect the arrival of Kuru.  Later, Skada would send emissaries to explain to Karuvaka why his father did not actually arrive, and what actually happened to him.  The evening after Karusaka the Second’s crowning, Skada called on Shukracharya, looking grim and disturbed.

	“What is it, Skada?”  Shukracharya asked.  He was as fond of the burly northerner as he had been of Kuru himself.  

	“Need to discuss something, Shukracharya,” Skada replied in his usual tacit way.  “Need to protect Karusaka, and the Kuru after him.”

	“There is only so much you can do, my dear son,” Shukracharya said.  “Karusaka now needs to carve his own destiny.”

	Skada shook his head in protest.  “We must provide platform, we must give him claim.”

	“He had a claim, the name of Karusaka the First and Vaivasvat Manu before him.  But Kuru rejected that name.  You know this well, Skada.”

	“Then new claim needed,” Skada said passionately.  “Why will people accept Kuru otherwise?  Not because of Bhargava.”  The last bit was not a slight to Shukracharya’s lineage, it was simply Skada’s way to be candid.    

	“What are you suggesting?”  Shukracharya asked.  

	It was clear that Skada had given this much thought.  His reticent manner was gone now, and he spoke with intent and clarity.  “Karusaka has brown eyes, not like Kuru and not like Manu.  But like Bharata, much like Samvarna who was lost in forest.  Kuru met Samvarna, and I did also.  No one know where Samvarna went.  We can say he stayed here, Khandakvana his home.  From him came Kuru, and from Kuru comes Karusaka.  We are of the line of Bharata then.”

	Shukracharya looked at Skada with wide, disbelieving eyes.  “You would align the Kuru with a name that has lesser claim on Aryavarta than Karusaka the First?”

	Skada nodded determinedly.  “No other choice.  Bharata rule Aryavarta now, not Suryavansha or Puru.”

	“Then so be it,” Shukracharya replied.
