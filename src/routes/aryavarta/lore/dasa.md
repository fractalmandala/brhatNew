>Aryavarta has made friends of us, there will be no more war between us.  We can finally look to a better future, a world where our cities do not cower under the fear of Suryavanshi attack.  We are both Aryas, we should both look westward.<br><cite>Dahamitara the Zarath Ustra to his detractors</cite>

“We have reached a crucial stage in our itihasa,” Rshi Vasishtha explained.  “The war between Suryavansha and Yadava was the first war between Arya tribes- an internecine war.  Prior to this, we only battled Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Yakshas and the other exotic tribes.”	

	“What was the real cause of this war, guruji?”  Sudasa asked.  He sensed that there were motives to King Haihaya and his son that were beyond his understanding.

	“Cause and catalyst are often different things, young one.  The strain between Suryavansha and Somavansha started during the later reign of King Nahusha- whose arrogance increased with his might.  A few years before his death, Nahusha raided the ancient Suryavanshi towns Sakala and Prasthala- laying claim to all land up to the Iravati river.”

	“And did the Suryavansha not retaliate?”  Sudasa interrupted.

	“It was the time of King Puranjaya, grandson to Vikukshi,” Vasishtha replied.  “As an honour to Ikshvaku, and the ancient bond between the two tribes, Puranjaya let Nahusha keep what he captured- ceding the Iravati’s eastern banks.  The tribes did not come to war then, but the first seeds of discord were sown.  Then Nahusha violated another tradition- he refused to send his sons for training among the Suryavansha.”

	“But Nahusha was a wise King,” Sudasa protested.  “He was the same man who forged peace with Gandharvas, and brought prosperity to the Ganga and Yamuna.”

	Rshi Vasishtha smiled at his ward’s innocence.  “If you were as old as I am,” he said, “Then you would know that we are rarely the same person in our dotage, as we are in our youth.  In his later years, Nahusha permitted himself much vanity.  There are myths that he sent vast expeditions into the Himalaya in search of Indra’s city- seeking to conquer even the realm of Devas.  As a student of itihasa, you now know that the Devas of our history and the Devas of our prayers are different entities- the former are humans who took the name, and the latter are the True Entities.  No doubt, the young Nahusha too received this education.  Yet the old Nahusha forgot the distinction.”

	“Then the actions of Nahusha were to finally cause war between Yadava and Suryavansha,” Sudasa concluded.  “But what was the catalyst, guruji?”

	“Yayati continued his father’s cold avoidance of the Suryavansha, and so did his five sons.  Within a generation after Yayati, the Suryavansha was suddenly surrounded on all sides by possible enemies.  They could not trust the Turvasas to keep away from Avisari, the Yadavas and Druhyus to ignore Vitabhya, or the Purus to stay east of the Iravati.”

	“And the Dasas were all along their western borders,” Sudasa added.

	“Exactly,” Vasishtha agreed.  “Such were the times that Kings Suyodhana, Anena and Prithu ruled in.  The actual catalyst for war, as it usually is- was scarcity.  The Yadavas had only the Charmanvati to water their lands with, and its basins are no fertile gift.  But the Suryavansha had Vitabhya- confluence of Sindhu, Shatadru and Sarasvati.  Understand this, young one- what Ganga and Yamuna are to Bharatvarsha, those three rivers were to Aryavarta then.  From the glacial streams around Avisari to the warm waters at Vitabhya- the Suryavanshi lands were richly endowed.  This is what the Yadavas coveted.”

**Year 251, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

Dahamitara was in love with the river.  It gave him a peace that existed nowhere else, rare moments of solitude for a Seer King- someone the Suryavanshi called a Rajarshi.  To his people though, he was known as Zarath Ustra- the Golden Camel.  On the banks of the Hetumanta, shielded on the east by the Hemakuta, he had made his home.  Harautii was his capital, the center of his power, and the only place that had been able to hold him for so long.  The decision was also strategic- passage to Harautii was possibly only by river, which was sufficiently blocked both upstream and downstream.  His people had lauded him for the location, declaring far and wide that Dahamitara was indeed a wise and capable Zarath Ustra.  Yet he had gone one step further, he decided to forget the past and make peace with the Suryavansha.  With no more horse riders to invade his lands, Dahamitara had truly brought safety and sustenance to his people.

	“Tell me about the Asuras,” said Aneni, his wife and sister to the Suryavansha King Prithu.  When they had eloped, then King Anena believed it to be the curse of Narantaka come true.  It was Crown Prince Prithu who brokered peace and marriage.  For that act that Dahamitara owed Prithu, and doubt still plagued him whether he could truly repay that debt.

	“Ahuras,” he corrected.  Aneni was still unaccustomed to the Dasa dialect, though not for a lack of trying.

	“Ahuras,” she said, “Tell me about them.”

	“What is there to say, apart from what you already know about your Asuras?”

	“Except that it is the other way round, isn’t it?”

	“Yes and no,” Dahamitara replied.  “Yes, because while your rituals are to the Daevas, ours are to the Ahuras.  No, because we all pray for the same things, don’t we?  We ask for peace, land, cattle and crop.  Then how does it matter, who we pray to?”

	“It matters, because only one side has the true power,” she argued.

	He raised his eyebrows, suspicious.  “Is that what your Rshi Vasishtha taught you?”

	“No,” she admitted.

	“I thought so.  You are of your father’s radical mould, my love.”

	The captain of his guard stepped into the dwelling, stopped before the curtains and called out, “My lord, a hvaha returns.”

	Dahamitara frowned, spies did not return unless there was dire news to convey.  He glanced to his wife, and she understood from the look in his eyes that she was to retreat.  “Send him in,” he said.  As Aneni withdrew, he grabbed her hand and pulled her back for a gentle kiss.  She blushed a bright shade of pink, and blended into the curtains.

	“My lord,” the spy bent upon one knee.  He had numerous bruises and cuts upon him, marked by dry blood stains.  His hair was disheveled, and there was a wild look in his eyes.

	Dahamitara searched his memory for the name, and found it.  “Turvara,” he said, “Rise.  It has been four months since you left us.”  He picked up a pot of water and handed it to his spy.  The man gratefully gulped it all down.  He was panting by the time he was done.

	“You obviously rode long and hard to reach us,” Dahamitara said.  “Come, deliver your report and take rest.”

	“My lord,” Turvara started, “Dhritaspa prepares to rebel against you.  He has amassed a force two thousand men strong, all Dasas from south of the Hetumanta.  Only Dhritaspa knows where this army is headed, but I was able to spy on a conversation between two of his generals.”  The man stopped, licked his lips and gulped, his eyes glancing towards the empty water pot. 

	Dahamitara understood and refilled the pot before handing it over to him.  “Go on,” he said, mildly irritated.

	Turvara took measured sips this time, between saying, “The generals seemed to think that the army is marching for Vitabhya, the Suryavanshi capital.  They also mentioned that another force will attack the capital, from the south and east.  Then their conversation moved to the names of their most capable warriors, and I removed myself from the scene.  That is all of my report, Zarath Ustra.”

***

The brutal realities became visible only at close quarters, but from a distance, the view of a battlefield was truly grand.  Five thousand men had gathered at the vast plains south of the Lorikdanai river, and Dahamitara had his enemy outnumbered three to two.  The Zarath Ustra held sway from Harautii to Haroivaha, his gathering of forces was swift and decisive.  Four days away from Vitabhya, he positioned his troops right at Dhritaspa’s path.  His foe was caught unawares, but Dahamitara knew that there was no way out of this, except for a full-fledged, deadly war. 

	“Do we really want to do this, my lord?”  Asked Bakahura, his chief lieutenant, for what seemed like the umpteenth time.

	Dahamitara speculated on the question yet again.  Was it truly wise to pit Dasa against Dasa, in defence of the Suryavansha?  Already soldiers bantered that the Zarath Ustra had sacrificed his loyalty, for satisfaction in bed.  But it was not about that, it was about the fact that Dhritaspa had rebelled.  As much as Dahamitara preferred peace, he could not tolerate unrest and division.  He said so to Bakahura, who fell into an introspective silence beside him.

	Somewhere in that mass of warriors was Dhritaspa, guarded most likely by a quadrant formation of four sword men.  Dahamitara’s finger itched to wrap his arms around Dhritaspa himself, but one-on-one battles amid conflicts like this were more the stuff of legends and ballads.  He raised his right arm, and the row of archers on either side pulled out an arrow each from their quivers.  His sword men were on the battlefield below, well away from his archers’ firing range.  Dahamitara fully expected Dhritaspa to anticipate that, and within moments of the battle the enemy warriors would run through Dahamitara’s line to confuse his archers.  Those initial moments were critical, his archers would have to hit as many of the rival soldiers as they could, before they would be rendered useless.  The only reason that Dhritaspa’s men had not charged yet, was because now, so outnumbered on an open field, the rebel Dasa was hoping for a truce.  But Dahamitara intended to send a message here, and he raised his right forefinger.

	The archers drew their arrows and pulled tight, strings tense with deadly potential.  From somewhere out in the field, Dhritaspa noticed the movement on the hillock and realized the threat.  Dahamitara heard his foe’s roar, and saw his line charge.  He brought his right arm down hard, and the first three hundred arrows took to air.  The archer front line retreated and the second line emerged, their arrows already drawn.  These were trained men who understood the nerve of the battle, they released even as they took their positions, and retreated just as quickly.  By the time the first line came back out in front, Dhritaspa’s men had charged through to Dahamitara’s line, and friend or foe could no longer be determined.  

	The battle cries of thousands of men sounded as one, constant roar.  It beckoned Dahamitara closer, inviting him to become a part of it.  He uttered a prayer of his own creation, careful with the pronunciation:

“To thee, O Sickness, I say avaunt!  To thee, O Death, I say avaunt!  To thee, O Pain, I say avaunt!  To thee, O Fever, I say avaunt!  To thee, O Disease, I say avaunt!”

	“May Ouruna will it true,” added Bakahura.

	“Come, Bakahura,” said Dahamitara, “Let us join our brothers on the field of blood and sword.”

	“Aye, my lord,” replied the lieutenant, as he pulled his sword out and followed his Zarath Ustra down the hill.

“Scouts in the west report that a ferocious battle rages two days’ ride from here,” said Senapati Kala, his clothes and armor soiled with dirt.  “It is Dasas fighting Dasas.”

	“My messenger should have reached Harautii by now,” Prithu said.  “We will receive word from Dahamitara soon, but till then leave that battle alone.  What of the eastern camp?”

	“Dharma’s forces are being constantly replenished by men from Viratpuri.  At this point, my King, it is clear that the Puru King Pravira has aligned with the Yadavas.  Our camp will hold for at least two more days, but we need Dahamitara’s famed archers to fortify our defenses.”

	“Dahamitara will respond,” Prithu said confidently.  “And the southern camp?”

	“Not good,” Kala replied with obvious distaste.  “Our line has been forced to retreat twice, and as long as Sivobheda keeps sending men, we are at a disadvantage.”

	“Any news from Pusya Janaka?”

	“None yet, my King.  But the passage to Nimipuri is treacherous and harsh, we cannot even be sure that the messenger reached him.”

	Prithu nodded grimly.  A Kingdom spanning from Avisari and Kapisa to Vitabhya, and he was still surrounded on all sides- a fate traditionally reserved for Suryavanshi Kings, it seemed.  “Very well,” he said.  “Reinforce the line to the north, and prepare the fleet.”

	Senapati Kala had made to move out, but he stopped at Prithu’s last words.  “The fleet, my King?  What are we to do with it?”

	“The fleet is useless to me here, Vitabhya cannot be defended from the river.  But if King Druhyu finds it acceptable to attack my city, then I will attack his.  Arm the fleet completely, and send it downstream for the city of Mohandvara.  Destroy the city, but let the citizens flee if they so choose.  I will not lose a city today, but Druhyu certainly will.”

***

“The Zarath Ustra’s head, a present from King Dhritaspa,” the messenger’s voice was laced with impudence. 

	Prithu’s eyes went to the unrecognizable, bloodied bust of his brother-in-law.  “Outnumbered,” the messenger continued, “Dhritaspa fought off the army of Dahamitara, and personally slew him.  The Dasas answer to him now, and the alliance between us is broken.  This is the verdict of the new Zarath Ustra.”

	Prithu took a deep breath, fuming and agitated.  This meant that he was now surrounded by enemy armies on three sides, and his sister was in the clutches of Dasas.  Suddenly he wished the fleet was back here, those arms would at least add to the fast dwindling defense Vitabhya mounted.  He felt like a boy again, watching his father Anena making decisions about war and death from his throne.  “What are Dhritaspa’s terms?”  He heard himself ask.

	The messenger smiled, his teeth brown and broken.  “Leave Vitabhya, it will now be claimed by the Dasas.  Retreat all the way north of the Kamyakvana, and make the old capital of Rajavasa your southern border.”

	Senapati Kala snorted in disbelief.  “As always,” he shouted, “The Dasas offer impossible terms.  Dhritaspa knows that we will never accept this.”

	Prithu wasn’t listening, he was sharing another silent conversation with Rshi Vasishtha. What do I do, my Guru?  The King seemed to ask.  In return, Vasishtha’s gaze was penetrating, almost as if he asked,What does your heart say?

	With Dhritaspa’s forces on his western border, Prithu knew that the war was lost.  It would only be a matter of time before the enemy penetrated into Vitabhya, and he did not trust them to be generous to the civilians. You are nothing like me, his father had once said to him.  It was true enough, King Anena would never entertain what Prithu now considered.  He took a deep breath, and came to the decision.

	“Even if I accept,” Prithu said, “Druhyu and the Yadavas will come after me.  Seems to me, that the best move then is to stay here and fight, where I am the strongest.”

	Something in the messenger’s quick grin indicated that he expected this answer.  “The Zarath Ustra does have generosity within him.  Go run off to the north, where you came from, and he will ensure that no one chases you.  Druhyu and Yadava are for him to contend with then.”

	“My King!”  Kala interrupted in a tone of disbelief.  “You cannot be considering this!”

	“But I am,” Prithu said, strangely calm.  “I know that you would rather fight and die than flee, and so would I.  But I have four thousand citizens to think about, a burden a warrior such as you knows nothing about.  If I stay and fight, as my Suryavanshi ego tells me to, then my people will suffer death after my end.  What bravery do you find in that, what courage?  I will not stop you from achieving glory, my friend, but I will not join you in it.  Let me retreat in shame and ensure the safety of my subjects.  It may not be my duty as a Suryavanshi, but it is certainly my duty as a King.”

	Kala fell silent, unable to counter what his King said.  Just then, a soldier barged in against all protocol.  “My King,” he said excitedly, “King Pusya Janaka has sent men!  The city can be defended!”

***

“What?”  Dhritaspa barked.

	“Gandharva and Yaksha,” his lieutenant repeated.  “They come from the far north-west, sent by some distant cousin of King Prithu.”

	“Distant cousin?”  Dhritaspa repeated, incredulous.  “How many?”

	“Difficult to say, my lord, but at least one thousand.”

	The new Zarath Ustra snorted.  “And what difference does that make?  I have an army more than three thousand strong, and as many men surround Vitabhya from the south and east.  Why are we not making progress then?”

	“The new warriors are,” the lieutenant hesitated, trying to find the right word, “-different.  Their weapons and tactics are strange.  They make wild runs through our advance line and disorient the men, many are fatally or cripplingly wounded in the process.  This leaves the Suryavanshi forces free to defend the south and east.”

	“What of the north, can we not break their line there and enter the city?”

	“Not without unacceptable losses.  The north is still the most strongly defended end of the city, for it is the link to the rest of the Suryavanshi Kingdom.”

	Dhritaspa shouted in frustration.  This was not going to plan.  “Spread the line out wider,” he commanded, “Give these new soldiers more ground to cover.  They can’t run through us if we are a sparse formation.  And give the fighters some damn motivation!  They are not going back home if we do not have Vitabhya, let them know that.”

***

“My King, a large fleet has been spotted headed downstream from Vitabhya.  It was armed and heavily manned, the Suryavanshi banners flying high.”

	King Druhyu banged the table hard, his temper short under the sweltering heat and the makeshift tent.  “Why would he send the fleet out at a time like this?”  He asked to no one in particular.  “It can only mean one thing, the fleet is headed for Mohandvara.”

	“Mohandvara will not be able to defend itself against a fleet that large,” warned Minister Urdhravasa.  “We will lose that city, if we do not act now.”

	“And if we lose it,” Druhyu added, more for himself, “Then there goes all we have gained in the past decade.”  Mohandvara lay on the western banks of the Sindhu, and the tract of land between that city and Sivobheda was what Druhyu had made his Kingdom out of.

	Urdhravasa understood.  “I will order the retreat, my King,” he said.

***

“We cannot win the city,” said Dharma, “My supplies are nearly over, and yet Vitabhya stands strong.  Curse these Janaka warriors!”

	“So, just like your uncle, you plan to retreat as well?”  Dhritaspa challenged.  They had met at the southern end of Vitabhya, trying to figure out a way to overrun Prithu’s capital.  Dhritaspa’s motivations were purely ethnic, he had not forgiven past Suryavanshi crimes, even if Dahamitara had.  But through Dharma, a whole new world opened up to him.  The Yadava Crown Prince talked of metals and wood, ivory and leatherskins.  He talked of trade and barter, profit and loss. Vitabhya is where three grand rivers meet, my Dasa ally, Dharma had grandly declared upon meeting. It is the nodal point of trade, and controlling it means controlling the Sindhu and Sarasvati.

	“He who retreats today, can return stronger tomorrow,” Dharma countered.  “Uncle Druhyu has already left us, and I don’t see your men pressing forward either!”

	“Let us press together,” Dhritaspa insisted.  “Together, we may yet break the Suryavanshi defence.”

	“And die in the process, most likely,” Dharma drawled.  “Feel free to do so, but I’d much rather return home.  I’ve had my fun for today.”

	Dhritaspa scowled.  “What cowardice is this?  I have heard much about the ferocity of the Haihaya Yadavas.  I am seeing only the opposite.”

	“Watch your tongue, Dasa,” Dharma warned.  “My uncle Druhyu may have brokered an alliance with you, but I owe the Dasas no debt.  I will cut you where you stand.”

	“You will only lose your hand in the attempt,” Dhritaspa shot back. 

	Dharma’s eyes lit up.  “Wit!”  He remarked.  “I enjoy wit, so perhaps your company will be fun after all.  Come then, let us send our full force against Vitabhya.  Let us destroy these Suryavanshi, and then perhaps I can make you my court jester!”
