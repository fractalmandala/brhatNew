That is how evolved they are!”<br><cite>King Bhuvamanyu Puru to his sons Bheda and Shimyu</cite>


Keen, piercing and haughty- that was the gaze of Mitrayu, King-in-Waiting.  It was only a year before King Divodasa would step down and crown his sixteen year old son.  Mitrayu would then be King of all the lands between Vitabhya and Vinasana.  But for now he was his father’s Chief Commander, and he stared at the failed soldier with cold, unforgiving eyes. 

	The soldier dare not meet his commander’s eye.  He was a tall, weary man of forty-two with fading battle-scars ripped across his face.  Mitrayu knew that the man probably joined the military at the age of sixteen or eighteen, and fought countless battles for his father.  But past services for the tribe did not matter here, in the present.  “How did this happen?”  Mitrayu asked, his voice sharp as steel.

	“Our men followed the Maharshi deep into the forest, my Crown Prince.  He bypassed Rohitaka, and seemed to take a route leading east towards Hastinapura.  But then he disappeared within the forest, and our men lost his tracks.”

	These were trained men, Bharata soldiers who were delivered all the arts of hunting and tracking.  But a quack Maharshi managed to give them the slip, and Mitrayu felt his temper rising.  Maharshi Vishvamitra had evaded his forces for more than five years now, and always the origins of every Dasa attack would lead to his name.  Warrior, mystic, magician, Maharshi- all these and more were Vishvamitra’s many titles.  As to his own origins, there were no reliable reports.  Some said he was a Dasa from the far west- beyond Gandhara.  Others claimed he was a Yadava from Mathura- seeking revenge for King Pijavana’s sack of the city eleven years ago.  But the last of such rumors interested Mitrayu the most- that Maharshi Vishvamitra was a Bharata, from the royal lines no less. As a young royal scion he had easily dismissed such reports, but as a King-in-waiting he could no longer ignore them.  

	“Tell those men that they can either recover the tracks, or disappear in Khandakvana themselves,” Mitrayu commanded, having learnt the tenor and inflection of authority from his father early in his life.  “The Maharshi is undoubtedly headed for the Puru Kingdom, but I want those men to confirm this with their very eyes.”

	The soldier bowed and left, wondering what twist of fate birthed Mitrayu in one of First King Bharata’s direct lines- and himself in some outer, dotted descent.  The King-in-waiting turned his attention to the identity of Maharshi Vishvamitra, and reminded himself that it was now close to a year that Kaushika- son of Gathin, was due to return from his exile.  Yet there was no news of him, save Sudasa’s brief encounter a year ago.  It was looking more and more likely that Kaushika was in fact Maharshi Vishvamitra- embittered towards his dynasty for his exile, and seeking vengeance by rallying the Dasas and Druhyus together.  But this was a theory that Kings Divodasa and Pijavana vehemently rejected.  Their beloved brother Kaushika could never go against the family, and that too so secretively.  Only King Vishvaratha thought similar to Mitrayu, but he was too far from the current sphere of battle to be of any influence.

	Mitrayu sighed and stepped out of his makeshift tent, taking a deep gulp of the humid, fecund air around Kurukshetra.  With the monsoon in full swing, Khandakvana was battered by strong rains on a daily basis.  Several nights were stormy and thunderous, and there were reports of flooding around Kampilya, Prayaga, and Vitabhya.  It was as if Indra Deva himself was declaring the inevitable, impending war.  And if Vishvamitra was truly headed to meet the Purus, then it meant that he sought to broker the final alliance between Dasa, Druhyu, Puru and Yadava.  Like his father, Mitrayu did not think that wait and watch was the best strategy in such circumstances.  

***

“A thousand Kurus, three thousand of my men and the five thousand you have rallied from Prayaga and Kashi,” counted Mitrayu.  “This is more than enough to trample through Plaksha.”  He made a crushing gesture with his fist, clenching his jaws and baring his teeth.  

	Sudasa eyed his cousin.  Mitrayu had inherited all of his father’s bold aggression and merciless outlook.  But Sudasa was far more tempered, and cautious.  “An attack on Plaksha is no less than an all-out call to war, cousin,” he warned.  “King Bhuvamanyu Puru will take his entire force to battle, and the Puru army is no less than ten thousand strong.”

	“Far less than ours, when we combine all our forces,” Mitrayu countered.

	Sudasa sighed.  “You make it too simple, Mitra.  It will take more than a month for all of Kashi and Prayaga’s forces to get here, and even your men deployed on the Shatadru will take weeks in this weather.  But the land between Plaksha and Hastinapura is flat, clear territory.  King Bhuvamanyu’s gathering of his forces will be swift.”

	“What do you suggest then, Sudasa?  That we wait and watch while Vishvamitra brokers an alliance between the other tribes?”

	“We are not certain that Vishvamitra is up to anything like this,” Sudasa said.  “For all his legend and rumours, I have not seen him leading a single raid, fighting a single battle.  Such a man cannot find power among the Dasas and Druhyus.  Perhaps he is only someone who finds sympathy for their pains, and seeks to console it.  I have met many such people, Mitra.  Uncle Kaushika was one of them.”

	“Uncle Kaushika is Him!”  Mitrayu snapped loudly, temper getting the better of him.  “Why can no one else see this?  Even our soldiers’ descriptions of Vishvamitra match those of Kaushika.”

	“Brown eyes, sharp nose and tall gait- these are the features you talk about.  And that would describe half the men in all of Aryavarta.”

	Mitrayu’s nostrils flared as he tried to check his rising frustration.  “I am done arguing with you, brother.  And my father’s decision on Plaksha is final- we will attack.  The orders are for us to find and capture Vishvamitra alive, and then I will be proven right.

***

Father and son surveyed the map together, assessing the placement of soldiers with minds that thought alike.  “We need more men from Janmejaya,” King Divodasa said, unhappy with the number of his own placed on the map.  

	Next to them, Sudasa noted that his uncle did not refer to Janmejaya as King.  The Kurus’ revelation as descendants of Samvarna had been met with mixed reactions.  King Divodasa welcomed the strength they added, but he clearly did not consider them a prime, royal line.  Sudasa’s own father, King Pijavana had deferred to Rshi Vasishtha’s counsel.  The Prayaga Rajpurohit came out of a two day long prayer with Rshi Shukra of the Kurus and confirmed their claim to be true.  On the other hand, Kings Vishvaratha and Satyadhriti rejected all claims and declared the Kurus to be pretenders.  

	“King Janmejaya can spare only so much men,” Mitrayu said ruefully.  “The Kuru alliance with us is public knowledge now, and his capital is as vulnerable as Vinasana or Vitabhya.”

	“It can be done,” said Sudasa, unwilling participant to the war preparations.  With King Pijavana busy keeping the Yadavas at bay, Sudasa was left to aid King Divodasa’s campaigns.  “We need to bring the battle to the Purus on several fronts at once.  One thousand men is all we need from King Janmejaya.  Let them cross the Yamuna from many points, forming a line of advancing soldiers stretching from north of Haradvara to south of Hastinapura.”

	“And we can split our forces,” said Mitrayu, catching on to Sudasa’s plan.

	“Exactly,” said Sudasa.  “While the Kurus engage the Purus on all fronts and keep their strength widely dispersed, we can concentrate on their cities.”  It gave him no pleasure to form this plan.  An attack on the Puru kingdom would undoubtedly mean countless more innocent deaths.  And both Plaksha and Haradvara were spiritual centers- home to the Atri and Angirasa schools of rshis.  Sudasa did not want the blood of seers and ascetics on his hand.

	“A fine stratagem,” said King Divodasa after much thought.  “But we must make our objective clear.  The royal Puru line has to be destroyed, and this includes King Bhuvamanyu and his two sons.”  The King turned to his son and said, “Mitrayu, you and Sudasa will lead the contingents to Plaksha and Haradvara respectively.  I will take my force to Hastinapura and find King Bhuvamanyu.  Send word to the Kurus, our attack commences in less than six days.  We must finish the Purus once and for all, before Maharshi Vishvamitra forges an alliance between them and the Dasa-Druhyus.”

	The attack was indeed underway on the morning of the sixth day.  Twelve thousand Bharatas marched into the Puru Kingdom simultaneously- and this included Janmejaya’s thousand Kurus.  Mitrayu led four thousand men to Plaksha, far more than what was required to overrun the city’s forces.  Sudasa’s force of two thousand marched on Haradvara, circling west of Plaksha and riding hard to the Yamuna before crossing it for the city.  King Divodasa led six thousand to Hastinapura- capital of the Purus, single-mindedly focused on destroying the line of Bhuvamanyu.  And from the eastern banks of the Yamuna, forming a line that stretched yojanas along the line of the river, a thousand Kurus marched into the Kingdom to create chaos and disrupt King Bhuvamanyu’s defensive plans.  Haradvara was the lucky one in this attack- its citizens were left unharmed and the rshi schools given due accord.  But Plaksha bore the brunt of Crown Prince Mitrayu’s merciless, war-lusty excesses.  Atri and Kanva rshis were slayed indiscriminately and farmers, fishermen, potters and traders were not spared either.  It was not as if Mitrayu wanted to conquer the city- he wanted to lay it utterly to waste.  

	South in the Puru Kingdom, King Divodasa and his forces wreaked similar havoc on Hastinapura.  The old city of King Hastina Puru was built mostly of clay, wood and bamboo- there were no large, stably built structures and no royal complexes.  But it was still after three weeks of war that King Divodasa was able to push through to King Bhuvamanyu.  The mighty Kings met in open battle, their respective soldiers stepping aside and watching their Kings fight to the death.  It was a combat of technique versus fluidity.  King Divodasa’s sword was precise, sharp and quick while King Bhuvamanyu moved and danced with ease, parrying blows as if he was warding off pesky flies.  They were evenly matched, that much was obvious after the first few hours of their clash.  Around them, the scene of battle shifted as the forces of Mitrayu, Sudasa and Janmejaya caught up with Divodasa and surrounded Hastinapura.  Even as King Bhuvamanyu evaded Divodasa’s hard, violent blows the truth became clear to him.  His Kingdom was lost, yet again.  Plaksha and Haradvara were already defeated, and now the Bharata forces were upon Hastinapura.  

	Enraged, Bhuvamanyu roared and changed his momentum.  No longer did he calmly parry and evade, now he slashed his sword rough and rash, forcing Divodasa to get on the defensive.  “It was a mistake to ever let Hastina keep his Kingdom!”  Bhuvamanyu taunted between blows.  “The Purus will forever be a thorn in your side, Divodasa Bharata!”

	Forced to be evasive by Bhuvamanyu’s sudden charge, Divodasa shot back, “Not forever, Bhuvamanyu Puru!  Today is your final day, and that of your line.  After you, I will find your sons and slay them as well- something Mandhatra should have done to your line years ago.”

	Bhuvamanyu shouted in rage and slashed harder, raining solid, crunching blows against Divodasa’s shield.  Then suddenly, as he raised his arm for another blow, Divodasa found his chance.  He jabbed his sword straight, without preamble- almost as if this was the very moment he was waiting for all along.  The sword pierced through the surprised Bhuvamanyu’s gut, and the Puru King looked down to see the sword being sliced upwards on his torso- ripping apart his chest up to the neck.  Blood burst out angrily, taking all the breath and life out of him.  

	There was no grim pleasure on Divodasa’s face as his rival fell to the ground.  He looked to the Puru soldiers, who were gazing at their fallen King in dismay.  “It is over,” King Divodasa declared loud enough for all to hear.  “The Purus are defeated, and any Puru warrior who still holds his sword forfeits his life.  For the others, I have only one thing to say- leave now.  Leave Bharatvarsha and never return.  There is no place for Puru blood here.”  Then Divodasa walked over to his side and looked at his chief commander.  “Find the sons,” he said.  “The campaign is not over till we have killed the entire royal family.”

***

He was a warrior by birth, but even he paled at the sight of death and pain around him.  Injury and disease were widespread, and the constant influx of more wounded and ill was not helping.  Vishvamitra tried looking for his old friends, but Varanavati was not the same place he left years ago.  The shadow and horror of war brought chaos to what was once an organized, regulated village.  But what wrenched Vishvamitra’s heart the most was the knowledge that this was his dynasty’s doing.  King Divodasa had declared complete war on the Dasas, Druhyus and now Purus, raiding their cities and towns and causing the largest exodus of people from Aryavarta ever.

	Worst of all, Vishvamitra could not fathom the reason for any of it.  The prosperity of Bharatvarsha lay along its rivers in cities like Prayaga, Kanyakubja and Kashi.  Most of the Puru and Druhyu territories were nothing but wasteland, land turned dry and barren by the civilisations that once prospered on it.  This was wanton, uncontrolled aggression by his Bharata cousin, and Vishvamitra could do nothing about it.

	He went from wounded to wounded, whispering soothing mantras into their ears and sending silent prayers for their impending departures into the world of death.  But it was a losing battle, he knew that in his heart.  As long as the aggression from the Bharatas would continue, the influx of the dead and dying would go on.  The few raids he facilitated were doing nothing to dent the Bharata strength, and now that he was in Varanavati he was effectively cut off from the Dasa-Druhyus far west.  If he wanted to do something Vishvamitra, had to go into the arc of battle himself.  He needed to give the Purus a fighting chance.  He spent a few more days in Varanavati, helping set up healing camps for the mass of people that kept coming in from Haradvara, Hastinapura and even Plaksha.  Then, when he was sure that the village of Varanavati could handle this inflow of the diseased and injured, Maharshi Vishvamitra set off for the Puru Kingdom- now under control of King Divodasa of course.

“I would recommend that you not do that, young man,” said Vishvamitra, pointing his staff at the soldier.  

	The group of soldiers accosting the travelers turned their attention to him, and gave him glances of contempt.  He recognized the Bharata insignia on their armour, and the uniquely Bharata design to their blades.  At the age of thirty-eight, his body had not begun to show signs of age.  He stood tall and wide-chested- every bit the son of a royal dynasty that he was.  

	The three soldiers noticed only his rshi-like appearance.  “Move on, sage,” one of them said dismissively.  “This does not concern you.”

	“In fact it does,” Vishvamitra replied calmly.  He walked towards the men and they turned to him, weapons primed.  “I suggest you leave these travelers alone and be on your way, brave soldiers of Bharatvarsha.”

	The soldiers grinned, amused at the empty threat from a rshi holding a stick.  Meanwhile, the party of travelers retreated towards the base of a nearby tree.  Dust flew freely, causing Vishvamitra’s robes to sway in the wind.  He had taken to growing a beard of late, and it was already long enough to billow along with his hair.  

	Perhaps the soldiers were unaware of the identity of these travelers, or they would not be taking Vishvamitra’s advance so carelessly.  He was within stick’s reach of the lead man when the soldier finally backed up a step and shouted out, “Stop, I warn you!”  He slashed his sword viciously as a warning, its tip swishing past dangerously close to Vishvamitra’s face.  

	Vishvamitra stopped and smiled.  It had been some time before his bones experienced the pleasure of a good fight, but a warrior never forgets the skills he once acquires.  He felt hollow pity for these young men, no doubt loyal soldiers of the Grand Bharata Kingdom.  That very fact was their undoing today.  In a flash, Vishvamitra rolled ahead on the ground and smacked his staff at the man’s knees from the behind.  He was up before the others could react, and pushed the end of the staff straight into another’s face, breaking his nose instantly.  He swiveled around and blocked the sword of the third with his staff, expertly jutting his knee into the man’s solar plexus.  As the man fell to the ground Vishvamitra turned his attention to the first, giving swift, rapid blows with the staff into his waist and back.  The second man nursed his broken nose, wisely staying on the ground.  Vishvamitra kicked away their swords as he alternatingly beat the other two into submission.  

	He was barely out of breath by the time they relented.  Strangely, the travelers did not take this time to flee from the scene.  They stood there, looking at him in awe and gratitude.  Vishvamitra said to the soldiers, “Run away now, young men.  You will return with more, I know that.  But we will be long gone by then.”

	Abashed, the soldiers reluctantly picked themselves up and walked away.  Vishvamitra observed them till they were lost to sight, then turned to the three travelers- a woman and two young boys.  Twenty years of Vedic practice had taught Vishvamitra all the mantras that were there to know, but at this sensitive interaction he was still the awkward soldier.  More curtly than he should have, he asked, “Are you Devi Vigyata of the Purus?”

	The woman’s eyes widened in alarm, and that was the confirmation he needed.  “I mean no harm to you and these children, Devi,” he said, trying to be reassuring.  “I am here in fact to confirm your safety.  Yours, and of these sons of King Bhuvamanyu Puru.”

***

The elder boy was sixteen, not insensitive to the dark shadows over their lives.  The younger was twelve, still oblivious to much in the world around him.  But in their Puru-grey eyes Vishvamitra saw the future of their tribe, and it was only now that he began envisaging a grand alliance between Puru, Dasa, Druhyu, Yadava and any other tribe that had grievance against the Bharatas.  There was no sliver of filial guilt in him, he was Maharshi Vishvamitra now. and not Kaushika the son of Gathin.  His calling, his duties were to a higher tribe- that of all humanity.  And the Bharatas’ most recent campaigns were an attack on that very calling.  Vishvamitra did not reserve his anger for King Divodasa alone.  For every aggression Divodasa committed against the Druhyus and Purus, King Pijavana continued to maraud the Yadava territories and push them further south.  And King Satyadhriti of Kashi was guilty at least of non-intervention, if not anything else.

	“You may dress and talk like a seer, Rshi Vishvamitra, but you are a warrior.”  Declared Vigyata, the boys’ maternal aunt, breaking into his grim musings.  

	Vishvamitra frowned.  “Why would you say that, Devi Vigyata?”

	“I see the way you hold yourself,” Vigyata replied, “The way you grip your staff, and the way your nose is always pointed up in typical warrior arrogance.”

	Vishvamitra was learning that the Puru woman had a free tongue, and she wielded it often.  He accepted that in good grace and humour.  “Perhaps I do these things to better give the appearance of a rshi who can fight as well,” Vishvamitra suggested.

	Vigyata shook her head in the negative.  “It is not just that,” she said.  “I have much respect for the various clans of rshis, but their loyalty is forever to the mantras and rituals.  The loyalty you display, Maharshi Vishvamitra, is of a different kind altogether.  There is an oath or duty that you seem obliged to, which compels you to risk your life ensuring the safety of these young boys.  Only a warrior can be so foolish, and sentimental,” she finished with a triumphant look on her face.  

	Vishvamitra smiled enigmatically.  “You underestimate us seers, Devi of Purus.  You cannot presume to know what motivates me to look after the well-being of Puru blood.”

	Vigyata glanced towards the Puru-blood, which was currently embroiled in a brotherly scuffle on the ground.  With effort, she turned her gaze away from them and looked to Vishvamitra.  “Then tell me, Maharshi,” she said, “Tell me why you do this?  For many weeks you have refused to answer this question.  Maybe it is time that you let me in on your secret.”

	“It isn’t,” Vishvamitra replied softly, “Not yet at least. One day I will tell you and the boys, Devi Vigyata.  But that day is not today.”

***

“Again!”  Vishvamitra barked, making Bheda practice his attack again.

	Bheda got smartly back in formation, determined not to show any signs of fatigue.  In trained, calculated motions he repeated the entire attack, expertly moving from stance to stance.  Vishvamitra observed him with pride.  Next to him, the younger brother Shimyu gazed in open admiration.  

	Despite more than two decades of difference between their ages, Vishvamitra and Shimyu shared a deep, amiable rapport.  “It is not fair that you are leaving us now, Maharshi Vishvamitra,” Shimyu said while his brother trained, his tone accusatory.  “My brother seems well trained, but mine is yet to commence.”

	 Vishvamitra looked into those grey, Puru eyes of his younger ward.  “Our time together is not over, dear Shimyu.  I will return soon, and then your training can begin.” he said.  “But it is time I return to the land of my forefathers.”  Aloud, he said to Bheda, “That is enough for the day.  Commence your warming down exercises.”

	“But you refuse to tell us what land that is,” Shimyu added immediately after Vishvamitra stopped.  “Though I have made some guesses of my own.”

	Vishvamitra raised his eyebrows.  The boy’s mind was keen and tactical, even at the tender age of twelve.  “What would those guesses be, Shimyu?”  Vishvamitra asked.

	“Your hair is dark black and wavy, dense and fibrous- obviously the hair of Bharatvarsha.  So you do not come from any lands that are Dasa or Druhyu.  Your wide chest and great familiarity with weapons suggest that you have warrior lineage in you, and your gait has always indicated that the lineage is royal.”

	“Go on,” said Vishvamitra.

	“Your eyes are neither grey nor orange, and so you are neither from the Solar nor the Lunar.  You do not have the gaunt, deep sockets of a Yadava nor the yellow, slanted eyes of a Shaka or Yaksha.  You possess knowledge of the Veda that would only be available in one of these cities- Ayodhya, Kashi or Prayaga.”	

	“These are an awful lot of guesses, young Puru,” Vishvamitra said cautiously.  

	“But they are completely on the mark, are they not, Maharshi Vishvamitra?”  Shimyu asked.  “I submit that you are a Bharata, descended from the same family that has ousted and exiled my own.  I do not need you to tell me whether I am right, I need you to tell me why a Bharata would help a Puru.  Give me this last piece of knowledge before your departure, my Guru.”  Shimyu said that with no accusation in his tone, but deep humility and reverence.

	Vishvamitra sighed, feeling the weight of years bear down upon him.  “I have promised your aunt, Devi Vigyata, that I one day I will share the truth with you all,” he said, looking very pensively at the soil in front of his feet.

	Shimyu looked on, anticipation wide in his eyes.  “Yes, I am a Bharata,” said Vishvamitra at last, “From the family of Kanyakubja and Kaushambhi.  My given name was Kaushika, son of Gathin.  At the age of seventeen I was exiled from the Grand Bharata Kingdom for twenty years, though it has now been twenty one years since I have been home.”

	Again Shimyu only looked on, and Vishvamitra knew that he would have to give his youngest pupil the answer he wanted.  “It is a mistaken belief that the duties of the seer are different to the duties of the warrior,” he said.  “Both groups have the same directive- to preserve the sanctity of peace and order.  The rshi seeks to bring that order to the universe of elements and nature, the soldier to the world of men and death.  Waste is forbidden to both, as is unusual greed and unnecessary desire.  I was well on my route to becoming a rshi, when the aggressions of my cousins began.  These were royal warriors who were not satisfied with what they had, which was abundant enough as is.  I saw death, disease and pain being perpetuated in the name of Bharata glory.  It went grossly against two things, Shimyu.  One, the true meaning and fame of the Bharata dynasty and two, the true duty and oath of a warrior.”

	“But what else is a warrior to do, if not expand the land of his people?”  Shimyu asked, clearly taking Vishvamitra’s speech as another learning session.

	“That is the crudest, most simplistic understanding of a warrior’s path,” Vishvamitra said, “And I will not go into the esoterics of the main classes with you here.  But when the duty of a soldier becomes to rob the innocent of their lives and livelihoods, then something has gone terribly wrong in our understanding.  Suffice to say that, already years in exile, I found myself feeling detached and alienated from my own family.  The Grand Bharata Kingdom that I was once proud of became a haunting spectre of war and death all around me.  And then the unthinkable happened.”

	“An all-out attack against the Purus,” stated Shimyu.

	Vishvamitra nodded.  “More than seven thousand people lost their lives in King Divodasa’s unprovoked attack.  That was the final straw for me, when I decided that I would devote the rest of my life pitting my rshi strength and authority against the Vasishtha-backed spirituality of the Bharatas.”

	Shimyu was silent, trying to absorb this information about his guru and master.  His original question was forgotten by now, but Vishvamitra still remembered.  “Warrior and seer go hand in hand- King and Rshi must be together at the pinnacle of rule,” Vishvamitra continued.  “Ikshvaku had a Vasishtha, Pururava had an Atri, and every King since then has had a Rshi from one of the great schools to legitimize his reign and lineage.  I am simply seeking to turn that great convention around.”

	Shimyu wrinkled his burrows, trying to understand this latest piece of knowledge.  Vishvamitra smiled, sensing the confusion in his pupil’s mind.  “This time,” he said, “It is not a King that needs a Rshi for legitimacy, but a Rshi that needs the King for power.  There are no real Kings among the Dasas or Druhyus, Shimyu.  If we are to rally together against the Bharatas, then I need Kings- men around whose line and name the other tribes can unite.  And I will turn you and your brother into such men, it is now my purpose in life.”
