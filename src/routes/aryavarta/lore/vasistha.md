> One day you and I will have to decide whether we are to be friends or foes.  I have had great times with you, Sudasa, but do not begrudge me if I choose foe at that later date.  My father has done much to re-establish the Suryavansha, and I will put the furthering of that dream over anything else.”<br><cite>Crown Prince Dilipa Aikshvaku to Crown Prince Sudasa Bharata at their last parting</cite>


The formation of men moved in perfection, bodies betraying years of dedicated training.  Sudasa’s view from the balcony allowed him to discern the formation’s various limbs, but he did not recognize the pattern.  A central line of men constantly exchanged places as they practiced their attack and defense stances.  Branching out from them, several lines whirled around wildly, slashing sharp, metallic whips in oddly symmetric moves.  When the right side of the line waved slashing in, the left side waved slashing out, and vice versa.  Sudasa was hypnotized by the sight- these were fifty men who were moving like an entity with one mind.  There was no misstep, not a single move out of sync.

	“Together they cover a wide circumference of attacking Suryavanshi,” Dilipa said proudly.  “It’s called the Aikshvaku formation, named after our founder Ikshvaku.  Do you know what Ikshvaku means?”  

	Condescending and superior, that was Dilipa’s way of talking.  Sudasa tried not to mind it though, and replied honestly, “No.”  Would Dilipa know the meaning of Bharata, after all?

	“His real name was Kshauva,” Dilipa said in his best patronizing tone.  “Patronymic for Kshuva of course, which was Vaivasvat Manu’s given name.  But as a boy, he loved to chew on sugarcanes, often stealing from neighboring huts as well.  The word for sugarcane is ikshu in the prime Suryavanshi dialect, and it lends itself to the name Ikshvaku.”

	Sudasa looked back at the formation practicing below him, and now he recognized its shape- a sugarcane billowing in the wind.  The central line of men formed the sugarcane’s stalk, and those waving men with whips- its grassy blades.  Suddenly, he wished he knew more of warfare and battle tactics- he was sure he could find finer appreciation in the Aikshvaku formation, if only his knowledge was greater.

	Dilipa caught the awed look on his face, and looked suitably pleased.  The Suryavanshi Crown Prince was of muscular build at seventeen years of age, and had already led several battle campaigns against Rakshasas and Yadavas.  “The Aikshvaku formation is our most deadly, potent attack configuration,” Dilipa said.  “Those men down there are of my own blood.  Some of them are my cousins, some would be distant uncles or nephews- Suryavanshi all.  They are pulled into royal warrior duty from ten years of age, and imparted martial training from then on.  They know nothing else- only the metal and fire blended into their blood, both through birth and training.”

	There was nothing like this in all the Bharata Kingdoms combined, Sudasa was sure of that.  The Bharata armies did not even accept recruits below the age of sixteen, and most were kept away from real battle till they were twenty.  But then he glanced at the Aikshvaku formation, still practicing to perfection below him.  He did not need to know much about warfare to know that a single Aikshvaku formation was more than a match for any Bharata contingent.  Sudasa realized that no legends or tales he had heard about the Suryavanshi faculty for war were too exaggerated.  

	That evening, he pleaded Rshi Vasishtha to tell him of Ikshvaku, having heard Dilipa talk about him all day.  Rshi Vasishtha smiled at his fervor and said, “Ikshvaku’s tale comes early in our itihasa of Aryavarta.  I will share it with you on our journey back, which is tomorrow morning.  But now, you must meet Rshi Vasishtha- Rajpurohit of Ayodhya.  Unlike me, he is an actual descendant of the Maharshi Vasishtha.  You may gain more in one evening with him than you could from me in a lifetime.”

***

**Year 0 of the 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

He was palpably close now.  For months he had been on a heavy Soma diet, mixing the herb in almost everything he ate or drank.  It helped him penetrate deeper into the realms of consciousness than ever before, deeper into that light within his third eye.  He discerned countless secrets, stretched his mental capacities to beyond the limits he thought were possible. 

On this particular mental journey, he found himself on a mountain deep in the Himalaya.  Snow and wind pierced through him, and even from yojanas away he felt the brittle cold.  The air was fresher here, pure pranavayu circulating through his imagined lungs.  Unbidden, he realized that he was on the great Kailasa Mountain.  His physical body far behind on the banks of the Sarasvati, he peered down from the peaks of Kailasa to the grand lakes- Mansarovara and Rakshastala.  The wind rushed onto him faster when he flew off, and he could swear his physical body shivered, yojanas away.  He flew over the two lakes, following the faint path leading south into the middle Himalaya.  

Amid this bliss he felt a disturbance, a stirring that threatened to return his consciousness to its mortal vessel.  He shifted his observation towards his body and saw a party of horsemen riding towards it.  He watched as they approached his body and dismounted their short, stocky horses.

“What do we do?” One of them asked of the others.  “I’ve heard that these seers are prone to anger when disturbed.”  It was a fluid, familiar dialect- something from what he could call home.

“If he is who he is, then we have no choice but to wait,” another one replied matter-of-factly.  “We cannot go back without having informed Maharshi Vasishtha.”

  “So we just wait?”  A third one asked, his tone indicating that he wanted to do anything but.  “These rshis are known to meditate for days and months like this.  We can’t wait forever.  There are others to inform, and our journey is long.  At this rate, my own son will have grown up by the time we return!”

That was when the Soma took grip of his consciousness, and blurred his perception into random wisps of meaning and reality.  Colours consumed him, abstract fractals overwhelmed his perception and threatened to drive him insane.  But on the borders of his sanity he detected the vague tendrils of something relevant, something that held the answers to his exploration.  Colours changed to visions, and visions changed to memories, but he did not know if they were even his.  He journeyed through forests and along river banks.  Wild herds of horses and jagged, mountainous landscapes flooded his mind’s eye.  He saw pots being made, beads being wrung and metal being mined.  Then suddenly, he was back into his body, except this was not the body he knew and expected.  It was an alien body, one his consciousness had never inhabited before.  He felt it in the way the muscles reacted to his will, the way vision itself seemed different- as if he saw through someone else’s eyes and not his.  There were six others around him, all shimmering in a blue-white glow.  Their outlines swam in and out of view, the borders milky and translucent like the Akash Ganga.  He sensed that they waited for him to get his bearings, for him to recognize them and begin the proceedings.  One by one, he tried to discern them.

Two of them looked alike, he saw it in the curve of their noses and the slant of their eyes.  Their auras were of the same hue, and the shimmering patterns around them seemed strangely symmetrical.  Then it hit him, like a piece of knowledge instantaneously placed into his brain- they were named Bhardvaja and Gautama.  They smiled, as if they knew that now he recognized them.  He turned to the third, who stood tall and proud.  The look in his eyes was benign, but he sensed hostility in that aura, or was it arrogance?  Again the knowledge appeared inside him in the blink of an eye, this was Vishvamitra- his other half from one life, and twin from another.  The fourth figure was smiling widely, glowing amiably and welcoming him with twinkling eyes- Jamadagni.  The final two names came to him as soon as he turned to the fifth- Kashyapa and Atri.  They spread their arms out to him, and a seed appeared inside his mind, moist and fragile.

This seed came to him often, and his attention turned to it not out of conscious will, but because the Soma wanted him to.  On previous occasions, he would pry the seed open with his mind to find a Soma plant growing inside, yielding further seeds in an infinite loop of hallucinogenic frenzy.  Not wanting to get lost in that dissociative state again, he hesitated.  But the six figures around him moved closer, urging him to open it.  He did so- and out came the entire knowledge of the past, present and future; of who he was and what he was.  He was plunged into an ocean, cold and piercing, only to find that he was the ocean, potent and infinite.  In that ocean he felt the wave coming, and he knew what he had to do.

So it is time, he said to the six gathered around him.  He did not really speak though, for it was not speech that he uttered.  Instead, he sent out ripples in the ocean, and the others responded likewise.

Yes, Atri replied to him, and the others concurred, their waves overlapping perfectly.  

And we are the Seven, he said.

Yes, the others replied again.  He wasn’t really asking, and they weren’t really answering.  They were all simply saying the truth together, becoming part of the particular reality which held this Satya.  

Then the ocean receded, and he stood on the beach in physical form even as his real body still meditated under a tree.  The six were around him in flesh as well, and now when they spoke it was speech they uttered, not Sanskrit but something more raw and primitive.

“Will we be contemporaneous?”  Vasishtha asked.

“No,” Atri replied.  “You, Kashyapa and I exist now, as you know.  The rest follow later, or perhaps came earlier.”

 “And what precipitated this?”  He asked.

“All will be revealed, my friend,” Kashyapa replied, “Including what you have been searching for in your meditations.  You are close now, you sense it too.”

“Return to your body now, Vasishtha,” said Bhardvaja.  “Attend to those horsemen, and hear of how a new chapter begins in Aryavarta.  The horsemen will invite you to a ceremony up north, in the settlement of Sakala.  Your friend, Vivasvana, has become a proud father.”

Vasishtha’s lips curled in a soft smile, and he turned to Kashyapa.  “So you are to be a grandfather?”

Kashyapa nodded.  “Yes,” he said.  “The boy has been born with a great future, much of which you will discern yourself, in the years to come.”

The information had little impact on Vasishtha.  The Soma was wearing off and he was anxious to get back to his meditational journey.  Even Kashyapa had admitted that he was close to the truth.  Why were they wasting his time with mundane affairs then?

“You are in a hurry, we sense that,” Jamadagni said.  “But one last thing- as you return to your original body, the truth will be revealed to you, or at least its first and most fundamental component.  Within it, you will find the secrets of the entire universe.”

Jamadagni raised his right hand and touched Vasishtha in the middle of his temple with his forefinger.  Vasishtha felt his consciousness journeying towards his real body.  He was transported back to those fringes of sanity where he had glimpsed wisps of the truth, of Satya.  Then the fallout of the Soma retreat pushed him beyond the edge, and he found himself falling into intense blackness, pulled towards an unknown source by a force he could not understand.  He tried to peer through the darkness, but the non-consciousness continued to overcome him and numb his sensation, his very sense of being.  

Then finally, when he lost all sense of self and being, the veil broke and he snapped back into his body.  A split second before his consciousness re-entered its material vessel, the truth was revealed to him- just like the six had promised.  Devoid of a body for so long, his soul happily gulped in pranavayu and observed as the air went in and circulated through his lungs.  Then, with the exhalation his lips parted, and the Sacred Syllable was uttered for the first time.

“Aum,” Vasishtha chanted.   

***

Sakala was one of several Solar tribe settlements along the Shatadru River.  It was home to the chief Solar line- surviving through Vivasvana and now his newborn.  The village was decorated with lamps of ghee, and the single dirt road running through it paved clean and layered with fresh cow dung.  Every house was swiped clean and the water supply of the reservoir refreshed, this was a momentous occasion after all.  Chief Vivasvana’s wife, Saranya, had given birth to a healthy boy.  Sakala’s local rshi had already declared that the boy had great things in store for him.  The village’s inhabitants were now awaiting the arrival of Maharshi Vasishtha, who was Chief Vivasvana’s old friend and the infant’s godfather.

	Chief Vivasvana’s house was occupied by a steady stream of visitors.  Not everyone had seen the newborn yet, and families were still coming in to give their greetings and set their sight on Maharshi Kashyapa’s grandson.  The Maharshi himself was not present of course- he no longer maintained the links to his heritage, and was dedicated to meditation and asceticism.  Kashyapa’s pupil Vasishtha, however, was a Maharshi of the people.  He was advisor to the Solar confederation of tribes, spending most of his time between Sakala, Prasthala, Harayupa and Kashyapura. 

	Vivasvana had opted to live a modest life, not claiming special merit and privilege owing to his ancestry.  His establishment was exactly like those of the other families in the village.  Built of mud and baked clay bricks, there were two rooms and an attached bath area, apart from the front yard.  Saranya grew a few potatoes and carrots in the garden, and traded them with the village cowherds for milk.  One room was the common area where the Chief met the villagers and conducted his official duties.  The other room was the couple’s private chamber.  

The Chief sat in the main room on a grass mat, dressed in clean, white garb.  His long, black hair was tied up and rolled into a ball behind his head, and even his beard had been washed and combed into a neat, straight wave that ran down to this chest.  The village rshi sat next to him, repeating sacred mantras meant to make the elements harmonious to the newborn.  Saranya and the baby rested in the other room, the mother exhausted and the son sleeping.  Visitors would come in and pay their respects to the Chief before walking to the inner room and gazing upon the calm, resting son.

	Soon, a few urchins ran in to announce that Maharshi Vasishtha’s boat had been spotted on the river.  Vivasvana gestured to the rshi next to him, and silently took his permission to get up.  His attendants got the signal and prepared to escort their Chief to the river bank.  A bull-cart was ready outside, but Vivasvana decided to walk the distance.  By the time he reached the bank Vasishtha’s boat was within sight, and Vivasvana could even make out his friend standing at the helm, his hair coiled back towards the right as was his clan’s tradition.  Vasishtha was from a branch of the Solar tribes that settled in Prasthala, and his father was member of the ruling confederacy.

As the boat got closer, Vivasvana noticed that Vasishtha looked considerably older than the last time he had seen him, which was only two years ago.  His hair had turned white, and there were deep, ancient lines on his face.  The boat’s rowers brought it to the bank, and Vivasvana’s attendants prepared a wooden plank for the seer to alight.  Another attendant brought forth a tray carrying a vessel of water and a few pieces of clean, white cloth.

	There was a halo of power around Vasishtha; Vivasvana sensed it the moment his friend stepped off the boat.  Something told him that this was not the friend he could pull into an affable embrace and resort to childhood banter with.  Unmindful of himself, Vivasvana bent and touched Vasishtha’s feet.  The seer raised his right palm and placed it upon Vivasvana’s back.  “Aum,” he said.  

	The word was new to Vivasvana, and he looked up into his friend’s eyes to find that they were bright and vivid with wisdom.  Vivasvana knew his friend well, he had watched Vasishtha give his life to the spiritual quest.  He realized now, with a sense of distinct pride, that Vasishtha had achieved something of import in that journey.

	By the time he opened his mouth, Vivasvana was already looking upon Vasishtha as a Maharshi, not his childhood friend.  “I welcome you, Maharshi Vasishtha.  You bless Sakala with your presence.”

	Vasishtha smiled benignly, his eyes twinkling just for a moment to reflect their old bond.  Then the mask of a rshi was back on and he spoke in that deep, mystic baritone that the seers were prone to using.  “The forces work to connect us, they bring us together and intertwine our fates.  How are you, Vivasvana?”

“With Surya’s blessings, I am well,” Vivasvana replied.  “And as a new father, how can I be anything but elated?”

An attendant brought the tray forward and Vivasvana picked the vessel up.  He trickled the water slowly onto Vasishtha’s feet and washed off the loose dirt and debris.  Then he wiped the feet dry with a piece of cloth.  When he was done, Vasishtha had a smile on his face.  “You haven’t forgotten the old ways,” he commented.  This was how the ancient tribal leaders welcomed seers and priests to their homes.

“A Chief cannot afford to forget the traditions of his people,” Vivasvana replied.  He led Vasishtha back towards the village.  

“Your village has grown in size,” Vasishtha commented when the huts became clearly discernible.

	“We’ve seen migrations in the last few years.  More and more Solar tribes are giving up their nomadic ways.  Fishermen, miners, shepherds, ascetics and priests have congregated to Sakala and the surrounding area.”

	“I spotted many settlements along the river,” Vasishtha said, concurring.  “It seems our numbers are rising all across Aryavarta.”

	“The rshis do say that we are coming close to a golden age, a new Manvantara perhaps.  It has been more than five hundred years since the last of the Deva-Asura wars after all.”  Vivasvana said.  

	Vasishtha nodded knowingly.  “The rshis aren’t wrong.  And how is the newborn?”

	A grin broke upon Vivasvana’s face, and for a moment he looked like he might talk to Vasishtha, his old friend, again.  Then he recovered and somberly replied to Vasishtha the Maharshi, “Healthy and well, and so is Saranya.”

	They arrived at the village, and a large welcoming party awaited them.  The village rshi came forward and touched Vasishtha’s feet, in obvious awe of him.  Others followed suit, feeling blessed to have such a revered presence in their small village.  Vasishtha blessed everyone with equanimity.  Vivasvana guided Vasishtha to his hut, and they were followed by the village rshi and some of the other elders.  He waited for Vasishtha to sit and then sat down himself.

	“Unfortunate that Maharshi Kashyapa could not be here,” Vasishtha said when everyone settled down, locking his gaze with Vivasvana’s.

	“You know him as well as I do,” Vivasvana replied.  “Worldly affairs are of little consequence to him.”  Vasishtha had spent twenty years under the tutelage of Maharshi Kashyapa, earning his own Maharshi title from the father of his friend.  But while Kashyapa’s was the detached, isolated pursuit, Vasishtha followed a more involved approach with the Solar tribes.  He was singularly responsible for the spread of Kashyapa and Bhrigu’s brand of knowledge among the Solar confederacy.  

	Vasishtha looked around.  Apart from him and Vivasvana, there were seven others there, all among Sakala’s founders.  “I would like to speak with Chief Vivasvana in private,” he said, his voice deep and mystic again.  It made what he said sound like a benign but potent command.  The villagers of Sakala obediently got up and left, leaving the two alone.  

	When they left, Vasishtha turned to his old friend.  His sagely mask visibly dropped and he seemed much more at ease.  “Vivasvana,” he said affectionately, “The mere sight of you brings pleasure to my heart.  Would I be amiss if I request to see your son first, before we talk any further?”

	The change in demeanor startled Vivasvana.  This was not the somber, powerful seer from a few moments ago.  This was Vasishtha, his humble childhood friend.  Vivasvana smiled and said, “I would have been offended if you hadn’t asked.”

	Vasishtha returned the smile and the two friends got up together.  Vivasvana led him to the inner chamber, where Saranya slept in a corner.  A bamboo stand had been erected to curtain her bed and separate it from the rest of the room.  The baby slept in a wooden cradle on the other side of the curtain.  On their entry, the maid stood up and rushed to touch Vasishtha’s feet.  

“This is Vinati,” Vivasvana introduced.  “She is Saranya’s distant cousin and lives here with us as Saranya’s help.”  Vinati took Vasishtha’s blessing and retreated, allowing the two men privacy with the child.

	The infant was peacefully asleep, snuggled by the soft cushions placed all around him.  Vasishtha and Vivasvana stood there gazing at him, both smiling fondly.  “Even rshis can start families, you know,” Vivasvana whispered.  

	“All in good time, my friend,” Vasishtha replied enigmatically.  “He looks like you.  The same nose, lips and eyebrows.”

	“His ears are Saranya’s,” Vivasvana replied.

	Vasishtha nodded.  “That is good,” he said.  “There should be something of both father and mother.”  He looked up at Vivasvana and said, “Come, let us not disturb the sleeping mother and infant any further.”

	As they walked back, Vasishtha asked, “When is the naming?”

	“There is a muhurta in the evening that is propitious,” Vivasvana replied.

	They proceeded to sit on the grass mats on the floor, and Vinati came and placed a vessel of fresh water next to them before retreating.  Vivasvana watched her leave and then turned to Vasishtha, giving his friend a long, searching look.  Then he said, “You’ve changed.  You look older, much older.  I know you’re not weaker or in bad health, I can see that in your blazing eyes.  But something has definitely changed.”

	Vasishtha nodded in acceptance.  “Much has,” he replied.  “I have your father to thank, in part.  You are aware of his affection for Soma, I believe?”

	“Very well,” Vivasvana said.  “Last I heard, he had constructed an ashrama somewhere in the north-east, near the Himalayan foothills, dedicated solely to the production and research of Soma.  I’ve tried one variant, but that’s a plant for the rshis, not simple Chieftains like me.”

	“You might not be too wrong,” Vasishtha agreed.  “Anyway, on a recent meditation, the one where I was disturbed by your messengers incidentally, I hit upon a vital breakthrough.  I believe I’ve unlocked a key that may reveal the entire eternal knowledge to us.  It is the extraction of this key that has taken its toll on my physical body.”

	Vivasvana was curious now.  This was much like their childhood days, when Vasishtha would venture into the forests for days, and return with esoteric revelations.  Most of them went over Vivasvana’s head, but he had always enjoyed the intellectual stimulation.  And his own father’s spiritual background had imbibed him with a deep sense of respect for the thinkers and sages of his land.  He looked at Vasishtha now with a profound feeling of pride.  His childhood friend had evolved into a pure seer, a veritable extractor of the sacred mantras.  “And what is this key?”  He asked of Vasishtha.

	“Aum,” Vasishtha replied in a deep, rounded tone that began as guttural and ended nasal.  “This is the beginning and the end,” Vasishtha continued, “The wakeful and the asleep.  This is the key that unlocks the eternal code.”

	“Aum,” Vivasvana said, sounding out the word.  It felt powerful and potent.  Vasishtha nodded in approval.

	“That’s not all,” Vasishtha said.  “I’ve made some calculations on time, for while time itself is a fluid entity, the divisions and eras placed on it are human.  The time to set a new Manvantara count has come, and your son has been born at just the propitious moment.  It is inevitable that the title and responsibility must fall to him.”

	Vivasvana’s eyes widened, and his mouth fell open.  For a long while he was speechless, and then he muttered incoherently for a bit.  Finally he said, reverentially, “The Manu.”

	“Yes, the seventh of his line.  He will be the great progenitor for the next wave of humans, who will come to tame the land of Aryavarta.”

	Before Vasishtha could reveal anything else, an attendant walked in and bowed before them.  “Pardon me for disturbing you, Maharshi Vasishtha and Chief Vivasvana.  But Rshi Maitra begs me to remind you that the auspicious muhurta is upon us.  This is the right time to name your son.”

	Vasishtha turned to Vivasvana.  “Come, before I overwhelm you further, let us attend the naming ceremony of the Seventh Manu.”

	The two friends got up and proceeded to the village’s banyan tree, which was the main ceremonial area.  Vinati walked out with the Chief’s son in her arms, looking proud and privileged for her job.  Behind her, looking weak but dignified walked out Saranya.  Her skin was fair and radiant, not like Vivasvana’s dark, tanned skin.  She was a Gandharvi, and her homeland was far beyond the Himalaya, on the other side of Mount Kailasa.  Her marriage to Vivasvana had been a vital breakthrough in conflicts between the early settlers and their Gandharva rivals.

	Rshi Maitra made all the necessary arrangements.  A large number of the village folk gathered and formed a ritual circle around the main banyan tree.  Rshi Maitra sat in the center near the base of the tree, or rather in the left of center.  It was clear that he left the central position vacant for Vasishtha.  Vasishtha however offered the position to Vivasvana, and sat down to his right.  A ritual fire was kindled in front of them, and various components like ghee, oil and dry rice cakes were placed in large, open containers.  Four wooden spoons with long handles were placed next to the containers.  Vasishtha gave the preparations an approving look, and his eyes glinted in Rshi Maitra’s direction, who was assisted by his retinue of trainees.

	When everyone had taken their place, Rshi Maitra began in that typical, sagely baritone, “Oh Usha, we appeal to you at this hour.  Bless us with your auspicious presence among the elements.”  With one of the spoons, he poured some ghee into the flames and uttered, “Svaha.”  Then he turned to Vasishtha, “Great seer, there is none greater here than you.  I submit to you and pray that you take over this ritual.”  He held out the spoon with his right hand and held the wrist with his left, looking reverentially at Vasishtha.

	Vasishtha’s eyes twinkled when the flames danced across them, and he held out his hands in gentle protest.  “With a grandfather like the Great Kashyapa, this child should be named by him.  In his absence, I will fulfil that role.  But you are the rshi of this village, and this is both your right as well as your duty.  The elements will not harmonize with the child if his village rshi abstains from the birth and naming ritual.”

	Maitra knew that Vasishtha was right, and he dropped his outstretched hands.  “Then please grace us by naming this child, great seer; and placing him within this universe.  We can then proceed with the ritual.”

	Vasishtha nodded in acceptance, and gestured for the infant to be brought to him.  As it was being placed in his arms he said, “Let the father and mother of this child come to my either side.”  The parents obliged, and Vasishtha continued while Rshi Maitra began pouring ghee into the fire and chanting mantras.  “I will place this child first,” Vasishtha said.  “Within the cosmic arc of Bhumandala, he occupies space on the island of Jambudvipa.  On this island, his continent is the great Aryavarta, bound by the mountain ranges of Hemakuta and Himalaya, and this land will be conquered by his sons.  In Aryavarta, he comes to this earth in the village of Sakala on the banks of the Shatadru.”

	Maitra uttered a loud “Svaha” and poured some ghee and oil into the flames.  Meanwhile, one of his pupils added more logs to the fire.

	“Now I name this child, and I beg the Devas listen- for this is no ordinary naming.”  Vasishtha glanced at Vivasvana, who looked blank and numb.  “From Surya the Last came his grandson, Marici.  To Marici was born the Great Seer, Kashyapa.  Kashyapa fathered Vivasvana, Chieftain of Sakala.  From Vivasvana and Saranya is born this child, who I name Kshuva.  Vaivasvat is his patronymic, and he will be known as Vaivasvat Manu, the seventh of his line, the Great Progenitor.  Under the watchful eye of the elements, and the patronage of Usha, thus I have named this boy.”

	A loud chatter rippled across the gathering.  A new Manu had been declared, and they were witness to this.  The declaration was made by none other than Vasishtha, the Great Seer.  The village of Sakala was the most blessed land in Aryavarta on this evening.
