> The great Bharata Kings are long gone.  It has been centuries since we had a King to match the glory of an Ajamidha or Brhat.  But Sudasa is different, in him I see the signs of a great ruler.  It is only a matter of time before the Suryavanshi also birth someone to regain their lost valour.<br><cite>Rajpurohit Vasishtha to his colleague in Ayodhya</cite>


Sudasa could hardly sleep that night.  His mind was flooded with visions of ancient tribes on the march- of grim, bearded men of the Solar tribes.  Not satisfied with what part of Kashyapa’s tale Rshi Vasishtha had shared with him, he begged for more.  But the guru had insisted that the remainder had to wait till the next morning.  Word had arrived early at dawn of a skirmish with Yadava forces on the eastern banks of the Yamuna, near the Yadava city of Ekachakra.  Sudasa was still too young to take up arms, but he desired to fight alongside Bharata soldiers as earnestly as he wanted to hear the rest of Rshi Vasishtha’s Aryavarta itihasa.   

	He was up just before dawn, and completed his bath and prayers before most of the other pupils were awake.  There were three morning prayers every Bharata had to conduct, always in a specific order.  The first prayer went to Indra- patron deity to the Bharatas.  “I salute you, Indra – under whose control are the horses, the chariots, the villages and the cattle.  I salute you, Indra- who gave being to the Sun and the Morning, who leads waters to all where they may go.  He who wrings all under his control is none but Indra.”  

Sudasa always uttered the prayer with deep reverence and sincerity.  Rshi Vasishtha had once explained to him- “Indra gets nothing from your prayers.  He does not wait in heaven with ears pecked and ego ready to be gratified.  A prayer is important only for the prayee.  It can bring faith, contentment, discipline, harmony and much more- all depending only on the one who is praying.  You can go through your rituals dismissively, and thus gain nothing from them.  But you can also conduct them with truth and belief in your heart.”   

His father, King Pijavana, never had the same sort of respect for Indra or his status as the Bharatas’ patron Deva.  To him the deity was only a symbol of authority and stature.  “The Suryavanshi took Surya, and the Somavanshi took Soma,” the King had once said to his son.  “Agni belongs to the Bhrigus and Varuna to the Anavas.  What was left for us to take but Indra!”

But Sudasa had inherited his guru’s fervour, not his father’s cynicism.  The Indra prayer was followed by an incantation to the river Ganga and its twin- Yamuna.  These rivers were the lifeline of the Grand Bharata Kingdom, and at Prayaga they met in holy confluence.  The final prayer went to the First King Bharata- founder-patriarch of the dynasty.  The hymn was composed by King Kasha- grandson to First King Bharata.  “As the Great Bharata fared across the land, as his warrior bands sped on urged by Indra; so let our rivers flow in rapid motion, so favour us, our holy ancestor.”

Rshi Vasishtha completed the morning rituals with his group of Vasishtha rshis, and joined Sudasa by the stream for the day’s lessons.  No sooner had he sat down that Sudasa said, “I’ve been wondering, guruji, that if Maharshi Kashyapa was the son of Marici- then does that mean that the Suryavanshi Ikshvaku was Marici’s descendant?”

Vasishtha smiled and nodded.  “Soon, my eager pupil.  Ikshvaku is an early protagonist of our story.  But first we must learn the tale of Kashyapa, and how he went from being the Solar heir to a Maharshi.  Now where did we leave off last night?”

“The Solar tribes were making their way into Aryavarta, and young Kashyapa was sending scouts to investigate Bhrigu- that ascetic on the mountain,” Sudasa replied. 

“Yes, Kashyapa did send scouts indeed.  And what he learnt from them only further kindled the young man’s curiosity.  He was a nomad by upbringing, but a keen, inquisitive mind by nature.  What business did a man have alone in the mountains, Kashyapa must have thought then.  His people were not familiar to the ascetic and spiritual aspects of ancient Aryavarta- their tightly-knit, tribal dynamics did not make for isolated, lonely modes of existence.  In the pastures and mountains of their experience, a solitary individual was a dead individual.  It was inevitable that Kashyapa would go looking for Bhrigu himself.”

“What happened then?”  Sudasa asked.

“Bhrigu changed Kashyapa, he turned a warrior-nomad into a man of spirit and prayer.  Kashyapa abdicated his inheritance of the Solar rule, and all the power that was once held by Marici became the property of a tribal conglomerate.  Kashyapa was with Bhrigu till the end of the latter’s days.  And somewhere in between, he met Maharshi Atri, which is a tale you have heard before, young Sudasa.  It is remembered in the children’s fable of the Tortoise and the Goat.  Come, narrate it to me now.”

Sudasa recited from his memory.  “The tortoise was a creature of water and river, the goat of land and grass.  Often the goat would graze by the river bank, and the tortoise hunted for fish in the waters.  But never would the two meet.  Then one day, the tortoise stepped out of the Sarasvati River and walked into Plaksha, which was the goat’s home.  The goat welcomed the tortoise and said- Of what world are you, oh creature with a domed back?  The tortoise replied- I come from the west, from the land of light and Sun.  To this the goat said- And this is the land of night and Moon.  What brings you to these parts?  The tortoise replied- I come to ask after your Devas, your prayers and your rituals.  They are shrouded to me from beneath the river surface, appearing only as impressions on the water that ripple and blur before my perception.  The goat befriended the tortoise and invited it to its home.  There the two conversed about their respective lands and people, beliefs and ways.  Then the tortoise said- I am headed further north, to the grand Himalayas.  The goat expressed alarm and warned- But that is the land of cold and ice, of savage creatures and snowy crevasses that would bring you death in an instant.  The tortoise was touched by the goat’s concern, but said reassuringly- Fear not, my friend of Plaksha.  I am a hardy creature and I will survive.  The high peaks beckon me, but so does this newfound amity between us.  Come then, come with me to the mountains and we will explore the glory of the Himalaya together.  The goat accepted, and then the two ascended the peaks together.  Higher and higher they went till they reached the very heavens, and it is there that they stayed.  We see them even today, in the constellations of the horned one and the water-dweller- Capricorn and Pisces.”

**Year 6985 of the Sixth Manvantara**

Kashyapa prepared himself for the toughest farewell- the one to his ten year old son Vivasvana.  The young boy simply did not understand that Kashyapa was leaving, he could not comprehend that the farewell meant that Kashyapa would not return.  Vivasvana hid behind the large, shadowing figure of Parvata, trying to avoid Kashyapa’s eyes.  

	“It is well that your father is no more,” Parvata said to Kashyapa as he stood between them.  He was the tribe’s eldest member- the patriarch.  After Marici’s death and Kashyapa’s abdication, the rule had passed to a confederate council, but Parvata’s voice still carried weight in all tribal decisions.  

	Kashyapa continued trying to look past Parvata and catch Vivasvana’s gaze.  He had debated this decision with Parvata several times, even when Marici was alive.  Parvata’s accusations were ever the same- that by abdicating rule Kashyapa had broken everything Marici had built, and that the confederate governance that now existed would not survive long without the strong leadership of the chief Solar line.  

	“Marici’s heart would break if he was here today, though I could say the same for the day you abdicated,” Parvata continued.  “You have destroyed any chance of a united, strong Aryavarta.  All for some obscure promise of ritual and religion that your father never endorsed.”

	Kashyapa sighed.  He had wished for some moments of solitude with his son, but Parvata was determined not to let him have that.  He did not begrudge the ageing man- Parvata had always held the tribe’s interests in his heart.  “But I am not my father, Uncle Parvata,” Kashyapa said patiently.  “I have given the tribe many years of my life, fighting and warring as hard as any man.  I have even fathered a son, and my ancestors cannot blame me for destroying the family line.  Now I wish to lead the rest of my life pursuing what I have always craved.”

	“The company of a senile old man somewhere in the mountains,” Parvata said with scorn.  Young Vivasvana had wandered off, distracted by a group of young mules grazing nearby.  Kashyapa was stuck with Parvata now.

	“I need not defend Bhrigu to you, Uncle,” Kashyapa replied, keeping his tone respectful.  “You and father were my physical preceptors- you taught me to fight and kill, to survive and protect.  But Bhrigu is my spiritual guide.  If you have taught me how to live, Bhrigu has taught me what to live for.”

	“For your tribe and your clan,” Parvata said instantly.  “That is the only thing one has to live for.”

	“We disagree on this, Uncle Parvata, and we have debated this endlessly.  Will you not let me have a moment with my son, before I go?”

	“No, that is more than what you deserve, Kashyapa,” Parvata said curtly.  “The boy belongs to our tribe, to his Solar lineage.  He belongs to the memory and symbol of Marici.  He is Surya itself, incarnated on earth so that Marici’s dream might be realised.  You hold no right over him.”

	Kashyapa sighed again.  If Parvata’s mind was made, then he could not change it.  He bowed his head in acceptance and brought his hands together in a namaskara.  “Farewell then, Uncle Parvata.  You have been a great master and mentor to me.  My proudest day was when I was able to walk into battle alongside you and father.  But now I must seek out my greatest day yet, which can come only when I have absorbed all the knowledge and wisdom of that senile man on a mountain.”

***

Kashyapa’s initial journey took him through the forests and marshes that were Kamyakvana.  He politely refused the tribe’s offer of a horse, preferring to make his journey on foot.  Countless streams wound their way up and down between the Iravati and Shatadru Rivers and through the Kamyakvana, which was home to more varieties of fruits and animals than Kashyapa had record of.  He spotted several four-footed animal varieties that would be unknown to any of his tribe, and committed them to his memory.  The route would take him east right through the forest, winding south of known Rakshasa territories and finally reaching the Shatadru River’s western bank.  From there, Kashyapa planned to build a raft, cross the river then resume the journey to Plaksha- the distant village by the Sarasvati.  

	He made hard and long travel during the days and slept on tree branches at night, after knocking and tapping to drive away snakes and monkeys.  Once he would have hunted animals for their meat, but now he stuck to wild fruits and berries, having given up the consumption of flesh after his first encounter with Bhrigu.  He distinctly remembered the ascetic’s comment, delivered with keen disdain- Your body is not a graveyard for the rotting carcasses of animals.  Both Marici and Parvata had laughed loudly when Kashyapa related that to them- the Solar tribes were more the consumers of flesh and tendon than grain or vegetable.    

	After a particularly close encounter with a tiger, Kashyapa used his fruit-knife to fashion his stick into a spear.  It gave him an added reach over wild animals, and he would not have to sully the fruit knife with blood.  Monkeys troubled and teased him all along the journey, clearly annoyed by the intrusion of a larger, erect ape.  But their constant chatter helped keep other animals away, and when they called in alarm to each other and scattered, Kashyapa learnt to take cover himself.  The streams were small and shallow, easily crossed by holding his gear above the head and wading through.  Alligators and water snakes were a threat though, and more than once he had to find a different spot to cross- the one he initially chose being occupied by alligators.  

	He made sure to conduct his prayers both in the morning and the evening.  The mornings always began with the Surya Namaskara- the elemental prayer of his tribe.  It was followed by a fire-ritual he learnt from Bhrigu.  Agni is not just an element, Bhrigu had once explained.  Agni is the very mouth of the Devas.  Whatever goes into it is delivered straight to them, it must pass through Agni before becoming fit for the Devas.  The fire-ritual was also supposed to feature Soma, but Kashyapa’s stock was limited and he used the plant sparingly.  For several hours after his morning prayers, he would keep chanting the basic Agni prayer that Bhrigu had taught him- I laud Agni, the High Priest, God, Minister of Sacrifice, the Invoker, Lavishest in Wealth.

	Bhrigu had a wealth of such prayers.  Most of them were to Agni, but some were to Indra and Soma.  The ascetic was a reluctant teacher, parting with his knowledge only after much dedicated goading.  He was even more secretive with the Soma.  Kashyapa had spent many months thinking that the man was prone to strange bouts of half-asleep, half-frenetic hallucinogenic behaviour before being introduced to Soma.  A sacred devotion to its properties came easily after that.  If Agni was the mouth of the Devas, then surely Soma was their nectar—their essence distilled into a simple plant.  It was the very gateway to their realms, a floodgate that once opened, exposed the mind to perceptions of the higher world of Shining Men.  

	It took him more than a month to cross the Kamyakvana and reach the Shatadru.  At the river bank he collected logs along with bits of vines and creepers, and tied them together into a reasonable raft.  He found himself smiling in memory of Bhrigu as he pushed the raft into the water.  The old sage had an extreme dislike for water bodies, avoiding them with a steadfast resolution.  The Shatadru was not a gentle river, its waters gushed swift and strong and kept pushing the raft further downstream.  Kashyapa’s crossing took a diagonal path, and it was well into evening by the time he made it to the other side.  There he untied the raft and threw the logs and ropes into the river one by one.  The land here was too pristine and natural to leave any man-made artefacts lying around.  

	He found himself a tree to sleep on and resumed his journey the next morning, expecting it to be relatively easier from here on.  There was little forest between the Shatadru and Sarasvati rivers and many small settlements could be expected.  There were rumours of a large town as well, somewhere downstream of Plaksha on the Sarasvati.  Kashyapa did not think he would pass by it though.  He planned to keep a path strictly east, with the Shatadru visible in the far north.  That way he would either make it to Plaksha straight, or come upon the Sarasvati only some distance downstream.  

	The tribal confederacy formed after Marici’s death had not yet extended its control to this side of the Shatadru.  Kashyapa knew that here he would find settlements vastly different to those back west.  He was prepared for the name of Agni or Soma being alien to these people.  But remnants or manifestations of Surya, Indra and Mitra were bound to be encountered.  

	It was after less than a week of travel that the first settlements began.  The people called themselves Yakshas and were dedicated, for the most part, to roots, soils, and grasses.  They possessed no cattle, no fishing, and did not know metal.  Theirs was a semi-nomadic existence.  They would live in one place for half a year, till the local supply of fruits and vegetables ran out.  Then they would move to a new place and the cycle would begin anew.  

	The Yakshas were friendly and hospitable, but Kashyapa could foresee a future where they came in clash with the tribes of land and river.  Soon, even the vast clearings in Kamyakvana would not be enough for their growing numbers.  And perhaps it would be Vivasvana leading them, if Parvata had his way.  But none of that was of Kashyapa’s concern now.  He had to make it to Plaksha and begin his foray into the Himalaya, looking for Bhrigu through those unmistakable traces and signs that only the ageing seer could leave behind- herbs, piles of wood burnt to ash and of course, discarded reeds of the dry Soma plant.   

***

Plaksha- a village older than any settlement back west.  Kashyapa spotted countless ashramas at the outskirts of Plaksha, on the other side of the Sarasvati.  This was a river far grander than any Kashyapa had ever seen.  He could see its glistening waters all the way back to where they disappeared into the Himalaya, and downstream the river twisted and bended so that he could catch light reflecting off its surface right till the horizon.  Beyond the ashramas across the river and behind the lining of trees, would be the village proper.  Among the Solar tribes of the west, the names Plaksha and Sarasvati were interchangeable.  Many referred to the entire river as Plaksha, unaware that there was a village by that name.  I have long forgotten where I am originally from, Bhrigu had once said to him.  But when I try to retrace my steps back from the mountains, Plaksha is as far as I can get.  Beyond that, the land and forest are completely unfamiliar to me.  

	Kashyapa waved to the people he could see across the river, and they waved back.  Then a man picked up a raft and began rowing to him.  The Sarasvati was gentle and shallow here, and the raft made quick progress.  

	“Namaskara!”  The rower called to him when within earshot.  “Are you seeking passage to Plaksha?”

	“I am,” Kashyapa shouted back.  “Thank you for rowing across.”

	The rower brought his raft to the bank and Kashyapa waded in.  “My name is Bhaskara, and I am a resident of the great village of Plaksha,” the rower introduced himself amiably as Kashyapa boarded the raft.

	“Greetings, good Bhaskara.  I am Kashyapa, from the village of Harayupa by the Iravati.  I have long yearned to visit your famed village.”

	Bhaskara was animated and talkative along the way back.  He was a fisherman by profession, employed in the services of one of the ashramas that dotted the Sarasvati’s eastern bank.  He asked Kashyapa endless questions about Harayupa and the towns around Kamyakvana, constantly comparing it to the forest of Khandakvana that began some distance south of Plaksha.  

	Kashyapa was welcomed by a group of ascetics by the bank.  They offered him clean fabric and water to wash himself, and presented him with small balls of sugar and flour- already far more welcoming to an outsider than Harayupa would have been.  A sense of xenophobia was unique to the Solar tribes, it seemed.  Bhaskara excitedly introduced Kashyapa to the gathering. 

	“Welcome to Plaksha, Kashyapa of Harayupa,” said an elder ascetic.  “My name is Atri, and I am the guru to this group of ashramas.  Pray, stay with us a night before visiting the village.  My disciples and I will be blessed to hear from a man from the Solar tribes of Harayupa.”

	Kashyapa was surprised at Atri’s knowledge.  “You know of the Solar tribes here?”

	Atri nodded and replied, “We know even of the great Marici, ruler and chief of the band of Solar tribes that settled east of the Sindhu.  Now a tribal confederation rules in his name, and the Solar tribes grow in number.  Is that not true, friend Kashyapa?”

	“It is,” Kashyapa replied, not adding that he was Marici’s son.  “How is it that you know so much about us, but we know very little of Plaksha?”  He asked.  

	Atri gestured for him to walk along, and led Kashyapa to a mud hutment roofed with dry bales of grass.  “Tribes settling down along the Sarasvati often make contact with Plaksha,” Atri explained, “Giving us news of your towns and villages.  And I confess that we are quite curious with our questions.  The story of Marici and his great migration is most fascinating.”

	Inside the hut were wide straw mats, and Atri gestured for Kashyapa to sit before sitting down himself.  He sat in a strange fashion, crossing his legs and keeping the feet over his knees rather than under.  “So what brings a traveller to us from Harayupa?”  Atri asked.

	“Plaksha is the oldest known village in this land,” Kashyapa replied, “a village of farmers, fishermen and seers.  I make my passage to the mountains, but I had to set my sight on Plaksha and Sarasvati.”

	“The mountains!”  Atri repeated in alarm.  “What would make a man want to climb those peaks?  You travel alone, do you not?”

	“I do, good Atri.  But this would not be my first time into the great Himalaya.  And the Solar tribes once pastured among the mountains.  Ice and snow still feel more like home to me.”

	“The Himalaya is nothing like the mountains you may have encountered back west, dear Kashyapa,” said Atri, ignoring the first part of Kashyapa’s reply.  “What if you injure yourself?  What will you do for food and water?”  Atri’s brows were furrowed in genuine concern for the visitor to his ashrama.  

	Kashyapa smiled.  He detected wisdom in the man’s eyes, an understanding that went deeper than the perceptions of routine existence.  “I am quite used to living on nature,” Kashyapa replied.  “Ice can be melted for water, and there are many juicy berries among the cliffs.  But enough about me, let us calm your curiosity for a while and kindle mine.”

	Atri grinned widely, looking affable and benevolent both.  His eyes were luminous and silver, like the moon.  His fair skin was in stark contrast to Kashyapa’s tanned, brown make.  “Ask away, Kashyapa of Harayupa.  What would you like to know?”

	“More about your ashramas, to start with,” Kashyapa replied.  “And what happens in them.  What are your rituals?  What Devas do you pray to?”

	Atri smiled at his visitor.  “We have had many travellers faring by Plaksha,” he said, “but none have queried after our rituals and prayers.  It is good to meet with a man of similar curiosity.  But we do not have rituals in the way the Solar tribes have them, good Kashyapa.  Nor are our prayers directed to the Devas.  Our activities are devoted more to the basic cycle of existence- to the successive levels of evolution that life must pass through.”

	Kashyapa inched closer to Atri, his ears keen.  “What levels are these?”  He asked.  “I feel that your spiritual inquiries are of a different nature than mine.”

	“Life begins and ends with the Golden Womb- the Hiranyagarbha,” Atri explained.  “It is the God of Gods, and there are none beside it.  Every entity alive comes from this Hiranyagarbha, for the God of Gods branches out infinitely and encompasses everything in existence.  From this Golden Womb comes the primordial cell of life, and from that cell comes an organism of the great and infinite ocean.  This organism multiplies, and from the water organism comes another that steps out on solid land- the realm of perception and consciousness.  Once out, it transforms into a great boar that supports the entire earth, for the activities of beasts and animals consist of toil and burden.  But the boar then achieves intelligence, and the ability to create- it becomes a half man-half boar.  The progeny of that bipedal boar grinds stone and creates the axe.  The son of the axe-man melts metal to forge a sword, and the man with a sword leads his tribes to settlement and civilisation.”  Atri was smiling as he said this, but his eyes twinkled at Kashyapa as if he was testing him- seeing if Kashyapa had followed and understood. 

	“These are the successive levels of evolution,” Atri added, “And only when we understand them can we begin aspiring to the next level.  With the settling of the Solar tribes, we have reached the current stage- the stage of sword forging men.  Where can we go next?  That is the question we seek to answer here, Kashyapa of Harayupa.  And for that, it is not rituals and Devas we need; only the deepest, most sincere journeys into our own consciousness.”

	There was no offence in Atri’s tone, his was a voice inclined to forthright and amiable conversation.  “I would offer a counter-argument,” Kashyapa said in a similar tone, “That your query and the query of elements need not be mutually exclusive.  The elements and the Devas that wield them are the indicators of existence itself, of the great machinery of this cosmos.  Call them the natural consciousness if you like.  Even Surya follows a cycle, both daily and yearly.  Agni has different stages of life- starting from that lone spark of the first flint-rub to the raging forest-fire that could go on for weeks.  And it follows from what you said, that even Devas are manifestations of the Hiranyagarbha.  Therefore, no study of the Gods of Gods can be complete without a study of the Devas as well.”

	Atri was smiling appreciatively by the time Kashyapa finished.  “What an invigorating theory,” he said excitedly.  “You must join my disciples for the evening discourse.  Listening to you will do them a world of good- I fear that they have been listening to my ramblings for far too long!”

	There was an easy familiarity about Atri, an aura of camaraderie that Kashyapa could not really resist.  Nor could he forget that Plaksha was the best estimate of Bhrigu’s origin- that perhaps Atri and Bhrigu had some blood in common.  Perhaps it was the spiritual joy of finding a man with similar interests as his own, but Kashyapa felt drawn to confess his true identity.

“I have a mentor in the mountains,” he said.  “A man who has taught me all I know, who has made me what I am today.  It was love for him and his wisdom that made me turn my back to my own father.  I rejected my inheritance and responsibility, paving way for the Solar tribes to break up into a confederation right after my father’s death.”

	Atri’s eyes widened as he absorbed Kashyapa’s confession.  “You are the son!”  He exclaimed loudly.  “You are the son of Marici, who abdicated his right to rule because of his experiences with Bhrigu, a wandering ascetic!”

	Kashyapa nodded.  “And now I return to the Himalaya to find Bhrigu again.  My life with the tribe is over, my life with the spirit is yet to begin.  There is a voice inside me insisting that I invite you, good Atri.  I feel that your company will be a kind boon, as will the endless inquiries we will undoubtedly share.”    

	Atri’s eyes were glazed in thought, deep creases forming on his forehead as he considered Kashyapa’s offer.  “I must say that the sight of the mountains has always tempted me.  The sun rises over Plaksha from over them, shining through valleys and drops before flying over the peaks- almost as if inviting us to the world on the other side.  And who better to make that journey with than the son of Marici, the man who could have extended his sway over all the land, and one day even to Plaksha!  I will make this journey with you, Marici-putra Kashyapa the Solar.  Let us find your mentor, and then I will see what sort of personality can make a man forego the pan-tribal command that is descended to him.”
