“King Satyadhriti sends his invitations,” said Pijavana to his wife.  “Crown prince Pratardana is to wed a Suryavanshi princess from Vaishali.”

	“That is delightful news!”  Said Aakriti, mother to Sudasa.  “Young Pratardana is a fine and handsome young man.  And a Suryavanshi princess must be a beautiful girl indeed.”  Daughter to Kampilya’s ruling general, Aakriti was fierce warrior daughter- aptly complementing the King of the Grand Bharata family’s prime line.  

	Pijavana nodded in agreement.  They could hear the rivers gushing in the background, their heavy sounds wafting in through the open windows.  A mound of hill stood between the Ganga and Yamuna just before they intersected, and on top were the royal quarters- constructed of metal and bricks.  “Satyadhriti has waited long enough,” commented Pijavana.  “Pratardana should have been married years ago.”

	“The young boy had an extended tutelage under the Kashi rshis, and he has been in battle so often since then,” said Aakriti.

	“True,” agreed Pijavana.  “At Mathura I saw the boy’s valour.  He is a capable warrior and leader- his sword as effective as his stratagems.  When I am gone, my dear, that boy will be there to guide our son.”

	Aakriti frowned.  “Hush now!  Talking of death does not befit a time like this.  We are to prepare for a wedding!  It has been years since the city of Kashi has played host to such grand an occasion.”

	Pijavana relented and smiled.  “I will be joining you later, however.  There are some important matters to attend in Kampilya.  I must meet your father and discuss our patrol plans in the light of recent events.”

	Aakriti was not satisfied by that.  “Can it not wait till after the wedding?”  She asked.  “I do not savour the prospect of a journey to Kashi without you.”

	King Pijavana was still smiling as he gave her his best placating look.  “Worry not, my dear,” he said.  “I have prepared a pleasant journey for you by boat.  You can sail at an idle pace, which would not be without its many scenic charms.  You can even take our son along!”

	Aakriti smiled at her husband, acquiescing.  “At least it will give me time with Sudasa.  Between Rshi Vasishtha and your war councils, the boy has barely visited me.”

Just ahead of Prayaga, the Ganga and Yamuna split once again while the Yamuna meandered off and then back again.  The boat took the longer route along the Yamuna, and from the first bend Sudasa could still see smoke rising from some of Prayaga’s larger brick kilns.  He imagined Kaushambhi further away in the same direction, and hidden beyond the horizon, but he could not be sure of his estimate.  

	Aakriti’s soft voice carried to him from the other end of the boat.  “I hear you have been spending increasing time with Rshi Vasishtha.  That is good, your grandfather knew the entire Veda by heart by the age of fifteen.”  She was talking about his formidable maternal grandfather- a man learned in Veda and also the general of Kampilya.  

	Sudasa turned back and sat down beside his mother.  The boat was rowed by four men on one end, and carried private quarters for the Queen and her son on the other end.  Their quarters gave way to a balcony at the boat’s tip.  The Ganga’s cool breeze wafted through their hair as they sat by the edge.  “Rshi Vasishtha refuses to teach me the entire Veda,” Sudasa said.  “He says that my mind needs to meditate on the parts I know right now.  Only when I can understand them completely, will I be ready for the next part.”

	“And how are you doing on that?”  Aakriti asked.

	Sudasa made a face.  “Not well,” he said.  “The parts by Maharshis Kashyapa and Vasishtha are especially complex, and I cannot even memorise the compositions of Rshis Gritsamada, Shunaka and family.”

	Aakriti gave her son an indulgent smile and ruffled his hair.  “Rshi Vasishtha is not known to be patient with his pupils.  Does he still rap your knuckles with a stick if you fail to remember?”

	“Not mine, not anymore.  But he isn’t teaching me the Veda now.  Instead, we are going through itihasa- the history of Aryavarta.”

“Really?  And what are you learning in the history of Aryavarta?”

	“Everything,” Sudasa replied happily.  “Rshi Vasishtha started with Ikshvaku- founder of the Suryavansha, and Aryavarta’s first King.  Now we have moved to Pururava- founder of the Somavansha.”

	Aakriti nodded knowingly.  “That is good, I must thank Rshi Vasishtha for this.  My father too shared the stories of Ikshvaku and Pururava with me, when I was young.  Has Rshi Vasishtha’s course reached the founding of the Somavansha yet?”

	Sudasa shook his head in the negative.  “Then let me tell you of it,” Aakriti said.  “And next time, you can impress your teacher with the tale!”

**Year 50, 7<sup>th</sup> Mv.**

“Their attacks grow brazen each time,” Devapi declared, his tone heavy with disgust.  He considered the Gandharvas a lowly tribe, and wore that hatred on his sleeve.

“Another raid, and we will lose more than the minimum needed to sustain our stocks.  A few old cows and limping bulls will hardly suffice.  And the Gandharvas will probably kill these ones rather than steal them.”  Ashvin, the young Senapati summarised.  Devapi and Ashvin were twins, together they made the right and left hands of their Clan Head.  Tall, stocky and muscular, their features belied their nativity- theirs was the fair skin, bronze eyes and burnt copper hair of Sringara, the mountain town on the banks of Vitasta in the north.  The town fell under Suryavanshi territory, yet it held closer trade and cultural links with Plaksha than with Avisari.    

“If we don’t act now, they will have us surrounded in a few years.”  Virata said grimly.  Shorter than the twins, he was leaner, and of a burnt skin.  “There are reports that large parties of Gandharvas have moved into the forest south of Plaksha.”  Virata was the oldest of the group, more than thirty years in age.

The lush, verdant village of Plaksha lay on the Himalayan foothills, nestled at the centre of the valleys carved by the Sarasvati as it began its descent into the plains.  This region was home to the fig tree- ‘plaksha’ in the Sanskrit dialect.  South of it began the dense and unexplored forest of Khandakvana.  Plaksha was where the young Pururava decided to establish his seat, even as his mother led most of the tribe south along the Ganga.  When he took the decision to stay back in Plaksha, little did he know that it would prove to be a most unfortunate location.  There were Gandharva settlements to the north in the Himalayan peaks, to the east near the lakes of Rakshastala and Mansarovara, and now to the south in Khandakvana.  All of these had sprung up, or at least become troublesome, only in the last decade or so.

   Pururava took a deep breath, feeling the cool, pleasant airs of the Himalaya entering his lungs and cleaning out the grime of dusty travel.  His group of four had spent the last two months scouting the regions south of Khandakvana, looking for new places to settle their growing numbers.  The task proved to be far more difficult than Pururava imagined.  To begin with, Khandakvana turned out to be larger than what previous scouts charted.  For endless yojanas the entire gap between the Sarasvati and Yamuna was occupied by the forest, leaving it impossible to journey south on land.  The rivers were gentle enough for boats to ply on, but there were crocodiles and alligators to worry about.  Even dolphins could easily overturn the boats in friendly curiosity.  Way south, when the forest finally cleared, the Sarasvati river branched west to the grand Lake Dvaita.  Pururava had favoured establishing the village there, but they soon discovered a settlement of Vanaras among the rolling hills south-west of the Lake.  While the Vanaras were known to be a peaceful collective, Pururava knew that no one would occupy a village so close to a forest tribe.  And yet there the options had ended.  As the plains opened up, there were enough towns occupying the fertile soils and inhabitable clearings.  Viratpuri, Upaplavya, Vinasana and Puskara- four towns already flourished in the Sarasvati plains.  To bring more people to settle there would mean unnecessary competition for resources and land.  East of the Yamuna, and further east among the Ganga and its tributaries were lands of marshes, mosquitoes and heat.  It would be generations before those plains could be tamed and made inhabitable by the initial band of settlers his mother had led down.  

So Pururava returned north with no place to settle his people, only to find that the Gandharvas had raided Plaksha five times in his absence.  His skeletal group of defensive soldiers was depleted by more than half, and their cattle stock had been all but wiped out or stolen.  What remained was the nascent community of potters, sculptors, farmers and rshis, who sustained Plaksha through their trade with the towns of the north-west.  Guilt overcame Pururava when the reports were given to him in complete.  He was the Clan Head, responsible for the safety and wellbeing of his people.  What’s more, he came to that position not through merit and leadership, but through inherited right.  The grandson of Maharshi Atri deserved no less, people always assured him.  But while everyone talked of his rights, it were his duties that Pururava worried about.  This was what he had learnt in his five years under Ikshvaku’s care.

“How many Gandharvas per raid?”  He asked at last.

“Fifty to sixty,” Devapi replied. 

“They fashion bows of wood, and their arrows are often tipped with poisons,” Ashvin added.  “These are not fatal poisons though, so if the injured can survive the wound itself, they recover.  I think metal is entirely strange to them, for they have neither armour nor swords or shields.  They favour short, sharp spears, and the tip is made of hard stone that pierces our armour if plunged by a strong arm.”  Devapi replied.

“Why are we not able to run them down with our horses?”  Pururava asked.

“Horses seem to fear them,” Ashvin replied, and there was clear distaste in his tone.  Bred of the north, he favoured horses and trusted their military advantage.  

“It’s not fear, but disgust,” countered Devapi.  “The horses know how vile the Gandharvas are.”  Twins though they were, Ashvin and Devapi often supported opposing ideas.  It made them all the more valuable to Pururava.  If Ikshvaku had one Haryashva, Pururava often liked to think, then he had two.

“In any case,” continued Ashvin, “It takes a seasoned rider to convince his horse to chase a Gandharva, and even then the chase is impossible once they run into the forests or foothills.  They know those passages, and our horses are hesitant in the terrain.  The Gandharvas disappear while our horses run around in circles.”

Pururava sighed.  He had underestimated the Gandharva threat entirely.  The very fact that they sent fifty to sixty in any raid hinted to how large their numbers had grown.  Rumours were that entire peaks and forests now belonged to Gandharva and Rakshasa clans.  In contrast, he left all of thirty-two soldiers to defend Plaksha while he went scouting south.  Ten now remained, three of them injured and one unlikely to recover.  The Gandharvas battled swift and lethal.  More often than not, a Gandharva blow was a killing blow.  Their short, lanky frames made many a soldier underestimate them to his own disadvantage.  

	He turned to Devapi.  “How many men can you call from Sringara, and how soon?”

	The twins exchanged a glance.  “Sringara can rally more than a hundred horsed riders,” Devapi replied confidently.  “And they can make the journey here within five nights.”

	Pururava frowned.  He had expected it to take lesser time.  “What of the frontier towns, Avisari and Kapisa?”  He asked.  “Can we not get riders from them?”

	Ashvin nodded.  “Many indeed, but it would take more than a fortnight before they reach us.  And I think they have problems of their own, the last reports talked of Yaksha raids.”

	Devapi spitted in disgust.  “The vile tribes are everywhere.  How long must we tolerate them!”

	Pururava had often wondered the same and more, in his childhood.  As a nine year-old, he put the questions to Maharshi Atri.  Sessions with his grandfather were rare, as Atri was prone to disappearing into the mountains for years at end.  But Pururava remembered each session as clear as day.

	“How is it, Maharshi,” the boy Pururava had asked his grandfather, “That all living things are said to be related?  How can the sage Kashyapa be the father of humans, Devas, Asuras and Danavas?  How could he, a human, father eagles, tigers and animals of all kind?”

	The questions had come out of him in a rush, eager as he was to learn as much as he could, before grandfather disappeared again.  The great sage had smiled at his grandson, eyes twinkling with what Pururava read to be pride.  “History is a complex and elaborate fabric, Pururava,” Atri had replied, his tone even and calm.  “The Kashyapa you know as a Maharshi, and the Kashyapa who fathered all sorts of animals and exotic tribes are not the same, though they may be considered to be of the same lineage.  Much of our knowledge of the previous Manvantaras is lost, as are the details of the ancient ages.  We know little of the times when Devas and Asuras were the First People on Earth, and most of our knowledge of them comes from their last years.  As a consequence, many a time historians draw connections where none exist, and name different people the same to aid preservation of the core things.  We do know that all life started with a single cell, the mythic chamasa.  The elaborate filial relations drawn between all kinds of life today are merely a reflection of the fact that we come from the same primordial chamasa.  Imagine that first cell as Kashyapa then, and you will find things to be simpler.”

	Nothing ever was simpler after sessions with Atri though.  The aged seer always assumed Pururava to know more than he actually did.  He used terms and referred to stories that were completely unfamiliar to him, and often Pururava would have to turn to some of the other elders to clarify what Atri would tell him.  He had come to understand the origins of the Gandharvas soon enough though.

“Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Yakshas, Vanaras, Pisachas, Kimpurushas and Kinnaras,” Pururava listed to his companions now.  “These are tribes descended from the Asuras.  Each war the Asuras lost to the Devas precipitated an Asura migration to the forests, mountains or west of Aryavarta.  Their vanquished descendants began returning to us as these tribes, at the dawn of the Seventh Manvantara.  Just like the Devas did to the Asuras, we must now do to the Gandharvas.  It is said that the last Deva to migrate into the Himalaya was Soma- and from Plaksha he began his ascent.  Naught for nothing is the family of Maharshi Atri called the Lunar.” 

	“What will your decision be?”  Virata asked in his coarse, broken voice.  “It is time we cast the Gandharvas back to where they came from.”

	“Then that is exactly what I decide,” Pururava said determinedly, for a moment looking remarkably like his Suryavanshi uncle.  “Too long we have suffered these raids only by bolstering our defences.  But we have better weapons, better armour and horses too.  We should we be on the offensive.”  He turned to Virata.  “There are isolated tribes that inhabit the marshes beyond the Yamuna and Ganga.  Mother’s scouts have reported that they have begun taming elephants.  Is this true?”

	“Sure,” Virata replied casually, “But how true?  A single fool in one village, in a misplaced attempt at displaying bravery, could have set off that rumour by trying to jump upon an elephant.  That does not mean that the tribes have truly begun taming the large beasts.”

	“Then find out,” Pururava said instantly, his tone inflected with command.  “If there is a sliver of truth to this rumour, I want to know.  Uncle Ikshvaku increased his power by adding horses to his cavalry, we can do the same with elephants.  In the meantime,” he turned to Devapi, “Send message to Avisari, Sringara and Kapisa.  My uncle will send us forces, and so will the Ashvakas aligned to him.  Till then, I will go west myself, to the towns between Sarasvati and Shatadru.  Madra and Trigarta are strong mining towns; we will find metal and weapons there, if not the hands to hold them.  And there are many family alliances I can call upon if necessary.”

	“What of Plaksha till then?”  Ashvin asked.  

“I don’t intend to leave Plaksha undefended,” Pururava assured Ashvin.  “When the men from Sringara and the western towns assemble, Plaksha will be the base of operations.  It is from here that we will launch our attack.”

	“So we’re finally doing it,” Devapi said.  He had long been hungering to take the offensive to the Gandharvas.

	“It will take time for the men to assemble, and we will have to arm them,” Ashvin warned.  “I will have to train them into companies too.  The horsemen of the north-west and the warriors of the plains don’t mix well.”

	“It will be daunting, I know,” Pururava admitted.  He knew that he was in the company of men who knew all his flaws and weaknesses.  “People made me the Clan Head over many older, more deserving candidates- simply because they believe I have some sort of a divine right.  But what have I delivered so far?  The tribes of Manu are as scattered as ever before, save the Suryavanshi.  And now we are threatened by these alien tribes.”

	“You have done much,” countered Virata, ever the loyalist.  “Your efforts have finally brought the north-western tribes into trade with southern towns.  Before you, Avisari and Kapisa had little to do with Vinasana and Upaplavya.  The scouts that mapped the pastures between the Yamuna and Sarasvati were sent by you, and the favour this brought us from the horsemen has given us easy access to stallions from the north.”

	“You would have me declared an accomplished Clan Head,” Pururava commented dryly.

	“No,” disagreed Virata, “Not yet.  You have done much, and this has won you loyalty and power from Kapisa to Viratpuri.  But you do nothing with this power, Pururava.  Command it, take hold of it and yield it now.”

	“What Virata is saying,” added Ashvin, “Is that perhaps it is finally time to do what Ikshvaku did, seventeen years ago.  He started his own dynasty and declared himself King- giving the people a figure to rally around.  Do the same, as his former student you have the right more than anyone else.”  Ashvin looked to Devapi, and together with Virata they kneeled- much in the fashion that the Suryavanshi knelt to their King.  “On this day, Pururava Aila the son of Budha, we proclaim you our King,” Ashvin said, his voice heavy with emotion.

	Touched, Pururava bent down and picked his friends up, thankful to have loyal men around him.  I am the son of Budha, he thought, and through him the blood of Soma flows in me.  Aloud he said, “Like my uncle Ikshvaku in the north-west, I too have inherited a divine dynasty.  In your company, my friends, I accept your title and promise to live up to it, only as a King should.  Today, we declare the emergence of the Somavansha.”
